Are world oil and gas supplies under threat? How could a new international accord on 
stabilising greenhouse-gas emissions affect global energy markets? World Energy 
Outlook 2008 answers these and other burning questions.
WEO-2008 draws on the experience of another turbulent year in energy markets to 
provide  new  energy  projections  to  2030,  region  by  region  and  fuel  by  fuel.  It 
incorporates the latest data and policies. 
WEO-2008 focuses on two pressing issues facing the energy sector today:
n 	 	Prospects for oil and gas production: How much oil and gas exists and how much 
can be produced? Will investment be adequate? Through field-by-field analysis  
of production trends at 800 of the world’s largest oilfields, an assessment of the 
potential  for  finding  and  developing  new reserves  and  a  bottom-up  analysis  of 
upstream costs and	investment, WEO-2008 takes a hard look at future global oil 
and gas supply.
n 	 	Post-2012 climate scenarios: What emissions limits might emerge from current 
international negotiations on climate change? What role could cap-and-trade and 
sectoral approaches play in moving to a low-carbon energy future? Two different 
scenarios are assessed, one in which the atmospheric concentration of emissions is 
stabilised at 550 parts per million (ppm) in CO
2
 equivalent terms and the second 
at the still more ambitious level of 450 ppm. The implications for energy demand, 
prices, investment, air pollution and energy security are fully spelt out. This ground-
breaking analysis will enable policy makers to distill the key choices as they strive 
to agree in Copenhagen in 2009 on a post-Kyoto climate framework.
With extensive data, detailed projections and in-depth analysis, WEO-2008	provides 
invaluable insights into the prospects for the global energy market and what they mean 
for climate change.

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY
The International Energy Agency (IEA) is an autonomous body which was established in November 
1974 within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) to implement an inter national energy programme.
It carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among twenty-eight of the 
 OECD thirty member countries. The basic aims of the IEA are:
 To maintain and improve systems for coping with oil supply disruptions.
    To promote rational energy policies in a global context through co-operative relations with 
non-member countries, industry and inter national organisations.
    To operate a permanent information system on the international oil market.
    To  improve  the  world’s  energy  supply  and  demand  structure  by  developing  alternative 
energy sources and increasing the efﬁ ciency of energy use.
    To promote international collaboration on energy technology.
    To assist in the integration of environmental and energy policies.
The IEA member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The European Commission also participates in the 
work of the IEA.
ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT
The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of   thirty democracies work together to 
address the economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at 
the forefront of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments 
and concerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges of an 
ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can compare policy 
experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate 
domestic and international policies.
The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea, 
Luxembourg,  Mexico,  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Norway,  Poland,  Portugal,  Slovak  Republic, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States.
The European Commission takes part in the work of the OECD.

FOREWORD
Out of the turmoil of the energy markets of the last 12 months and our evaluation of 
future influences on the sector has emerged a new underlying price assumption for the 
World Energy Outlook — an oil price through to 2030 which nudges twice the level in 
WEO-2007. The era of cheap oil is over.
This alone should be enough to make policy makers sit up. But so should the results 
set out in this volume. On present trends, just to replace the oil reserves that will be 
exhausted and to meet the growth in demand, between now and 2030 we will need
64 mb/d of new oil-production capacity, six times the size of Saudi Arabia’s capacity 
today. The big resources lie, increasingly, in a few countries, whose share of the world 
market climbs inexorably. The international oil companies have diminishing access to 
these reserves. Investment per barrel of oil produced has shot up. But big producers are 
becoming so wealthy that they are losing the incentive to invest. Though the resources 
are there, the world will struggle to satisfy its thirst for oil, even at today’s prices.
Consumers and producers are not at loggerheads. Producers have a sovereign right to 
determine what pace of development of their resources is in their national interest. 
Consumers respect this, though they also expect commitments to be met. But in any 
case, demand is booming in Middle East countries, too: they account for 20% of oil 
demand growth over the period to 2030. If prices rise still higher, they will drive even 
faster the search for non-oil solutions in OECD countries and oil-importing countries 
elsewhere.
High oil prices do, over time, serve one purpose now almost unanimously accepted 
worldwide: to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to levels which will not cause irreparable 
damage to the world’s climate. Relative to WEO-2007, this year’s figures show lower 
global  fossil-fuel  energy  use  and  greenhouse-gas  emissions.  But,  despite  the  price 
changes, the reduction is nowhere near enough. Global energy-related greenhouse-gas 
emissions still increase by 45% by 2030.
This situation can be changed. Negotiators at Copenhagen in 2009 will seek to do that. 
Energy is a big part of the total climate change picture — over 60% of greenhouse-gas 
emissions come from energy production and use — but still only part. We show here 
how energy relates to the total picture and, in detail, how to go about making the 
energy future sustainable as part of a global climate solution. All nations would need 
to be involved, in a fair and proportionate manner.
We have two options. We can accept as broadly inevitable the outcome portrayed here 
in the first part of our analysis, which shows the destination of the course on which we 
are now set; and prepare ourselves to adapt to that uncertain even alarming, future. 
This path would lead to possible energy-related conflict and social disruption.  Or we 
can plan and implement a new course, drawing on a united determination on the part

of governments and action by committed citizens across the globe. The International 
Energy Agency sets out here what needs to be done to arrive at a supportable and 
sustainable future. The IEA will work with all nations, member countries and non-
member countries alike, to help effect the necessary changes. For those who wish to 
see, this WEO points the way.
As last year, I pay tribute to Fatih Birol, who has conceived and directed this analysis, 
his team and the many others who have contributed. The calibre of their work matches, 
in depth, the profundity of the problems.

Our analysis of oil supply is based on a vast amount of field-by-field data that we 
compiled from a range of different sources. The primary source of this was IHS Energy, 
without whose assistance we would not have been able to carry out this work. We 
gratefully acknowledge their contribution. We are also indebted to the United Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  Secretariat  for  very  helpful 
discussions when building our climate-change scenarios.  
Our strategic approach and analysis benefited greatly from the expertise of the World 
Energy Outlook’s two Advisory Panels, comprising prominent experts in the fields of 
oil and climate change.  We are very grateful to our distinguished panel members for

37 Executive summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The world’s energy system is at a crossroads. Current global trends in energy supply 
and  consumption  are  patently  unsustainable  —  environmentally,  economically, 
socially. But that can — and must — be altered; there’s still time to change the 
road we’re on. It is not an exaggeration to claim that the future of human prosperity 
depends on how successfully we tackle the two central energy challenges facing us 
today: securing the supply of reliable and affordable energy; and effecting a rapid 
transformation to a low-carbon, efficient and environmentally benign system of energy 
supply. What is needed is nothing short of an energy revolution. This World Energy 
Outlook demonstrates how that might be achieved through decisive policy action and 
at what cost. It also describes the consequences of failure.   
Oil is the world’s vital source of energy and will remain so for many years to come, 
even under the most optimistic of assumptions about the pace of development 
and  deployment  of  alternative  technology.  But  the  sources  of  oil  to  meet  rising 
demand, the cost of producing it and the prices that consumers will need to pay for 
it are extremely uncertain, perhaps more than ever. The surge in prices in recent 
years culminating in the price spike of 2008, coupled with much greater short-term 
price volatility, have highlighted just how sensitive prices are to short-term market 
imbalances. They have also alerted people to the ultimately finite nature of oil (and 
natural gas) resources. In fact, the immediate risk to supply is not one of a lack of global 
resources, but rather a lack of investment where it is needed. Upstream investment 
has been rising rapidly in nominal terms, but much of the increase is due to surging 
costs and the need to combat rising decline rates — especially in higher-cost provinces 
outside of OPEC. Today, most capital goes to exploring for and developing high-cost 
reserves,  partly  because  of  limitations  on  international  oil  company  access  to  the 
cheapest resources. Expanding production in the lowest-cost countries will be central 
to meeting the world’s needs at reasonable cost in the face of dwindling resources in 
most parts of the world and accelerating decline rates everywhere. 
Preventing catastrophic and irreversible damage to the global climate ultimately 
requires a major decarbonisation of the world energy sources. On current trends, 
energy-related emissions of carbon-dioxide (CO
2
) and other greenhouse gases will rise 
inexorably, pushing up average global temperature by as much as 6°C in the long term. 
Strong,  urgent  action  is  needed  to  curb  these  trends.  The  15th  Conference  of  the 
Parties, to be held in Copenhagen in November 2009, provides a vital opportunity to 
negotiate a new global climate-change policy regime for beyond 2012 (the final year 
of coverage of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol). The conference 
will need to put in place a framework for long-term co-operative action to bring the 
world onto a well-defined policy path towards a clear, quantified global goal for the 
stabilisation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It will also need to ensure broad 
participation and put in place robust policy mechanisms to achieve the agreed objective.

38 World Energy Outlook 2008
The energy sector will have to play the central role in curbing emissions — through 
major improvements in efficiency and rapid switching to renewables and other low-
carbon technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). 
Securing energy supplies and speeding up the transition to a low-carbon energy 
system both call for radical action by governments — at national and local levels, 
and through participation in co-ordinated international mechanisms. Households, 
businesses  and  motorists  will  have  to  change  the  way  they  use  energy,  while 
energy  suppliers  will  need  to  invest  in  developing  and  commercialising  low-carbon 
technologies.  To  make  this  happen,  governments  have  to  put  in  place  appropriate 
financial incentives and regulatory frameworks that support both energy-security and 
climate-policy goals in an integrated way. Removing subsidies on energy consumption, 
which amounted to a staggering $310 billion in the 20 largest non-OECD countries in 
2007, could make a major contribution to curbing demand and emissions growth. High 
international  oil  prices,  by  deterring  consumption  and  encouraging  more  efficient 
demand-side  technologies,  push  in  the  same  direction,  but  only  at  the  expense  of 
economic growth and of living standards in consuming countries, both rich and poor. 
And  some  of  the  alternatives  to  conventional  oil  that  high  prices  encourage  are 
even more carbon-intensive. Many countries have made progress in crafting national 
responses, but much more needs to be done. A new international climate agreement 
is but a first essential step on the road towards a sustainable energy system; effective 
implementation is just as crucial. Delay in doing either would increase the eventual 
cost of meeting any given global climate target.
More of the same: a vision of a 
laisser-faire
 fossil-energy future
In our Reference Scenario, world primary energy demand grows by 1.6% per year on 
average in 2006-2030, from 11 730 Mtoe to just over 17 010 Mtoe — an increase of 
45%. To illustrate the course on which we are set, this scenario embodies the effects of 
those government policies and measures that were enacted or adopted up to mid-2008, 
but not new ones. This provides a baseline against which we can quantify the extent 
to which we need to change course. Demand grows at a slower rate than projected in 
WEO-2007, mainly due to higher energy prices and slower economic growth, especially 
in OECD countries. Fossil fuels account for 80% of the world’s primary energy mix in 
2030 — down slightly on today. Oil remains the dominant fuel, though demand for coal 
rises more than demand for any other fuel in absolute terms. The share of the world’s 
energy consumed in cities — an estimated 7 900 Mtoe in 2006 — grows from two-thirds 
to almost three-quarters in 2030.
Due to continuing strong economic growth, China and India account for just over half 
of the increase in world primary energy demand between 2006 and 2030. Middle 
East countries strengthen their position as an important demand centre, contributing 
a further 11% to incremental world demand. Collectively, non-OECD countries account 
for 87% of the increase. As a result, their share of world primary energy demand rises 
from 51% to 62%. Their energy consumption overtook that of the OECD in 2005.  
Global primary demand for oil (excluding biofuels) rises by 1% per year on average, 
from 85 million barrels per day in 2007 to 106 mb/d in 2030. However, its share 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Executive summary 39
of world energy use drops, from 34% to 30%. Oil demand in 2030 has been revised 
downwards by 10 mb/d since last year’s Outlook, reflecting mainly the impact of 
much higher prices and slightly slower GDP growth, as well as new government policies 
introduced in the past year. All of the projected increase in world oil demand comes 
from non-OECD countries (over four-fifths from China, India and the Middle East); 
OECD oil demand falls slightly, due largely to declining non-transport oil demand. 
Global demand for natural gas grows more quickly, by 1.8% per year, its share in total 
energy demand rising marginally, to 22%. Most of the growth in gas use comes from the 
power-generation sector. World demand for coal advances by 2% a year on average, 
its share in global energy demand climbing from 26% in 2006 to 29% in 2030. Some 
85% of the increase in global coal consumption comes from the power sector in China 
and India. The share of nuclear power in primary energy demand edges down over 
the Outlook period, from 6% today to 5% in 2030 (its share of electricity output drops 
from 15% to 10%), reflecting the consistency of our rule not to anticipate changes 
in national policies — notwithstanding a recent revival of interest in nuclear power. 
Nuclear output nonetheless increases in absolute terms in all major regions except 
OECD Europe.
Modern renewable technologies grow most rapidly, overtaking gas to become the 
second-largest source of electricity, behind coal, soon after 2010. Falling costs as 
renewable technologies mature, assumed higher fossil-fuel prices and strong policy 
support provide an opportunity for the renewable industry to eliminate its reliance on 
subsidies and to bring emerging technologies into the mainstream. Excluding biomass, 
non-hydro renewable energy sources — wind, solar, geothermal, tide and wave energy 
— together grow faster than any other source worldwide, at an average rate of 7.2% 
per year over the projection period. Most of the increase occurs in the power sector. 
The share of non-hydro renewables in total power generation grows from 1% in 2006 
to  4%  in  2030.  Hydropower  output  increases,  though  its  share  of  electricity  drops 
two percentage points to 14%. In the OECD, the increase in renewables-based power 
generation exceeds that in fossil-based and nuclear power generation combined. 
Massive investments in energy infrastructure will be needed
The  Reference  Scenario  projections  call  for  cumulative  investment  of  over 
$26 trillion (in year-2007 dollars) in 2007-2030, over $4 trillion more than posited 
in WEO-2007. The power sector accounts for $13.6 trillion, or 52% of the total. Most 
of the rest goes to oil and gas, mainly for exploration and development and mostly 
in non-OECD regions. Unit capital costs, especially in the oil and gas industry, have 
continued to surge in the last year, leading to an upward revision in our assumed costs 
for the projection period. That increase outweighs the slower projected expansion of 
the world energy system. The current financial crisis is not expected to affect long-
term investment, but could lead to delays in bringing current projects to completion, 
particularly in the power sector. Just over half of projected global energy investment 
in 2007-2030 goes simply to maintain the current level of supply capacity: much of the 
world’s current infrastructure for supplying oil, gas, coal and electricity will need to 
be replaced by 2030. To provide adequate assurances about the circumstances that

40 World Energy Outlook 2008
will govern future investment in energy-supply infrastructure, negotiations need to be 
concluded urgently on an international agreement on combating climate change and 
the implications for national policies quickly assessed. 
These projections are based on the assumption that the IEA crude oil import price 
averages $100 per barrel (in real year-2007 dollars) over the period 2008-2015, 
rising to over $120 in 2030. This represents a major upward adjustment from last 
year’s Outlook, reflecting the higher prices for near-term physical delivery and for 
futures contracts, as well as a reassessment of the prospects for the cost of oil supply 
and the outlook for demand. In nominal terms, prices double to just over $200 per 
barrel in 2030. However, pronounced short-term swings in prices are likely to remain 
the norm and temporary price spikes or sharp falls cannot be ruled out. Prices are 
likely to remain highly volatile, especially in the next year or two. A worsening of the 
current financial crisis would most likely depress economic activity and, therefore, oil 
demand, exerting downward pressure on prices. Beyond 2015, we assume that rising 
marginal costs of supply exert upward pressure on prices through to the end of the 
projection period.
Combined with our oil-demand projections, these assumptions point to persistently 
high levels of consumer spending on oil in both OECD and non-OECD countries. As a 
share of world GDP at market exchange rates, spending soared from 1% in 1998 to around 
4% in 2007, with serious adverse implications for the economies of consuming countries. 
That share is projected to stabilise at more than 5% over much of the Outlook period. For 
non-OECD countries, the share averages 6% to 7%. The only time the world has ever spent 
so much of its income on oil was in the early 1980s, when it exceeded 6%. On the other 
hand, OPEC oil and gas export revenues jump from under $700 billion in 2006 to over
$2 trillion in 2030, with their share of world GDP rising from 1.2% to 2%. 
Most incremental oil and gas will come from OPEC – 
if they invest 
enough
 
World oil supply is projected to rise from 84 mb/d in 2007 to 106 mb/d in 2030 in 
the Reference Scenario. Netting out processing gains in refining, global production 
reaches 104 mb/d. Although global oil production in total is not expected to peak 
before 2030, production of conventional oil — crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) 
and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) — is projected to level off towards the end of the 
projection period. Conventional crude oil production alone increases only modestly 
over 2007-2030 — by 5 mb/d — as almost all the additional capacity from new oilfields 
is offset by declines in output at existing fields. The bulk of the net increase in total 
oil production comes from NGLs (driven by the relatively rapid expansion in gas supply) 
and from non-conventional resources and technologies, including Canadian oil sands. 
The bulk of the increase in world oil output is expected to come from OPEC countries, 
their collective share rising from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2030. Their reserves are, in 
principle, large enough (and development costs low enough) for output to grow faster 
than this. But investment by these countries is assumed to be constrained by several 
factors, including conservative depletion policies and geopolitics. Saudi Arabia remains 
the  world’s  largest  producer  throughout  the  projection  period,  its  output  climbing

Executive summary 41
from 10.2 mb/d in 2007 to 15.6 mb/d in 2030. Non-OPEC conventional oil production is 
already at plateau and is projected to start to decline by around the middle of the next 
decade, accelerating through to the end of the projection period. Production has already 
peaked in most non-OPEC countries and will peak in most others before 2030. Falling 
crude oil and NGLs production is largely offset by rising non-conventional output, which 
keeps total non-OPEC output broadly flat over the second half of the projection period. 
Conventional capacity, net of natural production declines at existing fields, is set to grow 
in the near term, but dwindling new discoveries and a fall in the size of new fields are 
expected to drive up marginal development costs, leading to a drop in output. 
The  projected  increase  in  global  oil  output  hinges  on  adequate  and  timely 
investment. Some 64 mb/d of additional gross capacity — the equivalent of almost 
six times that of Saudi Arabia today — needs to be brought on stream between 
2007 and 2030. Some 30 mb/d of new capacity is needed by 2015. There remains a 
real risk that under-investment will cause an oil-supply crunch in that timeframe. The 
current wave of upstream investment looks set to boost net oil-production capacity in 
the next two to three years, pushing up spare capacity modestly. However, capacity 
additions from current projects tail off after 2010. This largely reflects the upstream 
development cycle: many new projects will undoubtedly be sanctioned in the near 
term as oil companies complete existing projects and move on to new ones. But the 
gap now evident between what is currently being built and what will be needed to 
keep pace with demand is set to widen sharply after 2010. Around 7 mb/d of additional 
capacity (over and above that from all current projects) needs to be brought on stream 
by 2015, most of which will need to be sanctioned within the next two years, to avoid 
a fall in spare capacity towards the middle of the next decade. 
Production of natural gas is also set to become more concentrated in the most 
resource-rich regions. Some 46% of the projected growth in world gas production in 
2006-2030 comes from the Middle East, its output tripling to around 1 trillion cubic 
metres  (tcm)  by  2030.  About  60%  of  the  region’s  incremental  output  is  consumed 
locally, mainly in power stations. Most of the remaining increase in world output is 
provided by Africa and Russia. If investments in these countries falter, lower gas supply 
could lead to greater reliance on coal and higher CO
2
 emissions.
The world is not running short of oil or gas just yet
The world’s total endowment of oil is large enough to support the projected rise in 
production beyond 2030 in the Reference Scenario. Estimates of remaining proven 
reserves of oil and NGLs range from about 1.2 to 1.3 trillion barrels (including about
0.2 trillion barrels of non-conventional oil). They have almost doubled since 1980. This 
is enough to supply the world with oil for over 40 years at current rates of consumption. 
Though most of the increase in reserves has come from revisions made in the 1980s in 
OPEC countries rather than from new discoveries, modest increases have continued 
since 1990, despite rising consumption. The volume of oil discovered each year on 
average has been higher since 2000 than in the 1990s, thanks to increased exploration 
activity  and  improvements  in  technology,  though  production  continues  to  outstrip 
discoveries (despite some big recent finds, such as in deepwater offshore Brazil).

42 World Energy Outlook 2008
Ultimately recoverable conventional oil resources, which include initial proven and 
probable reserves from discovered fields, reserves growth and oil that has yet to 
be found, are estimated at 3.5 trillion barrels. Only a third of this total, or 1.1 trillion 
barrels, has been produced up to now. Undiscovered resources account for about a third 
of the remaining recoverable oil, the largest volumes of which are thought to lie in the 
Middle East, Russia and the Caspian region. Non-conventional oil resources, which have 
been barely developed to date, are also very large. Between 1 and 2 trillion barrels of oil 
sands and extra-heavy oil may be ultimately recoverable economically. These resources 
are largely concentrated in Canada (mainly in Alberta province) and Venezuela (in the 
Orinoco Belt). The total long-term potentially recoverable oil-resource base, including 
extra-heavy oil, oil sands and oil shales (another largely undeveloped, though costly 
resource), is estimated at around 6.5 trillion barrels. Adding coal-to-liquids and gas-to-
liquids increases this potential to about 9 trillion barrels. 
Globally, natural gas resources are large, but, like oil, are highly concentrated in a 
small number of countries and fields. Remaining proven reserves amount to 180 tcm 
— equal to around 60 years of current production. Three countries — Russia, Iran and 
Qatar — hold 56% of the world’s reserves, while just 25 fields worldwide hold almost 
half. OPEC countries also hold about half. Remaining reserves have more than doubled 
since 1980, with the biggest increases coming from the Middle East. Although the size 
of gas discoveries has been steadily declining in recent decades in the same way as 
for oil, discoveries continue to exceed production. Ultimately recoverable remaining 
resources of conventional natural gas, including remaining proven reserves, reserves 
growth and undiscovered resources, could amount to well over 400 tcm. Cumulative 
production  to  2007  amounts  to  less  than  one-sixth  of  total  initial  resources.  Non-
conventional gas resources — including coalbed methane, tight gas sands and gas shales 
— are much larger, amounting perhaps to over 900 tcm, with 25% in the United States 
and Canada combined. 
But field-by-field declines in oil production are accelerating…
Globally,  oil  resources  might  be  plentiful,  but  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that 
they will be exploited quickly enough to meet the level of demand projected in 
our Reference Scenario. One major uncertainty concerns the rate at which output 
from producing oilfields declines as they mature. This is a critical determinant of the 
amount of new capacity and investment that will be needed globally to meet projected 
demand. The findings of a detailed field-by-field analysis of the historical production 
trends of 800 fields, set out in Part B of this Outlook, indicate that observed decline 
rates (the observable fall in production) are likely to accelerate in the long term in 
each major world region. This results from a fall in the average size of field and, in 
some regions, an increase in the share of production that is expected to come from 
offshore fields. Our analysis demonstrates that, in general, the larger a field’s reserves, 
the lower the peak relative to reserves and the slower the decline once the field has 
passed its peak. Rates are also lower for onshore than offshore (especially deepwater) 
fields. Investment and production policies also affect decline rates.
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Executive summary 43
We estimate that the average production-weighted observed decline rate worldwide 
is currently 6.7% for fields that have passed their production peak. In our Reference 
Scenario, this rate increases to 8.6% in 2030. The current figure is derived from our 
analysis of production at 800 fields, including all 54 super-giants (holding more than 5 
billion  barrels)  in  production  today.  For  this  sample,  the  observed  post-peak  decline 
rate averaged across all fields, weighted by their production over their whole lives, was 
found to be 5.1%. Decline rates are lowest for the biggest fields: they average 3.4% for 
super-giant fields, 6.5% for giant fields and 10.4% for large fields. Observed decline rates 
vary markedly by region; they are lowest in the Middle East and highest in the North Sea. 
This reflects, to a large extent, differences in the average size of fields, which in turn is 
related to the extent to which overall reserves are depleted and whether they are located 
onshore or offshore. Adjusting for the higher decline rates of smaller fields explains the 
higher estimated decline rate for the world, compared with that based on our dataset.
Natural, or underlying, decline rates are about a third higher on average than observed 
decline  rates,  though  the  difference  varies  across  regions  reflecting  differences 
in investment. (The natural decline rate strips out the effects of ongoing and periodic 
investment.) For the world as a whole, it is estimated at 9% for post-peak fields. In other 
words, the decline in production from existing fields would have been around one-third 
faster had there been no capital spending on those fields once they had passed their peak. 
Our Reference Scenario projections imply an increase in the global average natural decline 
rate  to  around  10.5%  per  year  by  2030  (almost  two  percentage  points  higher  than  the 
observed rate), as all regions experience a drop in average field size and most see a shift 
in production to offshore fields over the projection period. This means that total upstream 
investment in some countries will need to rise, in some cases significantly, just to offset this 
faster decline. The implications are far-reaching: investment in 1 mb/d of additional capacity 
— equal to the entire capacity of Algeria today — is needed each year by the end of the 
projection period just to offset the projected acceleration in the natural decline rate. 
…and barriers to upstream investment could constrain global oil supply 
Faster natural decline rates will mean a need for more upstream investment, both 
in  existing  fields  (to  combat  natural  decline)  and  in  new  fields  (to  offset  falling 
production from existing fields and to meet rising demand). In fact, total upstream 
investment (in oil and gas fields) has been rising rapidly in recent years, more than tripling 
between 2000 and 2007 to $390 billion in nominal terms. Most of this increase was to 
meet higher unit costs: in cost-inflation adjusted terms, investment in 2007 was 70% higher 
than in 2000. Worldwide, upstream costs rose on average by an estimated 90% between 
2000 and 2007 and by a further 5% in the first half of 2008, according to the IEA Index of 
Upstream Capital Costs. Most of the increase occurred in 2004-2007. Based on the plans of 
50 of the world’s largest companies surveyed for this Outlook (accounting for more than 
three-quarters of world oil and gas production), global upstream oil and gas investment 
is expected to continue to rise, to just over $600 billion in nominal terms by 2012 — an 
increase of more than half over 2007. If costs level off, as assumed, real spending in the 
five years to 2012 would grow by 9% per year — about the same rate as in the previous 
seven years.

44 World Energy Outlook 2008
The  Reference  Scenario  projections  imply  a  need  for  cumulative  investment  in 
the upstream oil and gas sector of around $8.4 trillion (in year-2007 dollars) over 
2007-2030, or $350 billion per year on average. That is significantly less than is 
currently being spent. This is due to a major shift in where that investment is needed. 
Much more capital needs to go to the resource-rich regions, notably the Middle East, 
where unit costs are lowest. In short, the opportunities for international companies 
to invest in non-OPEC regions will diminish as the resource base contracts, eventually 
leaving the countries holding the bulk of the world’s remaining oil and gas reserves to 
take on a larger burden of investment, either directly through their national companies 
or  indirectly,  in  partnership  with  foreign  investors.  It  cannot  be  taken  for  granted 
that these countries will be willing to make this investment themselves or to attract 
sufficient foreign capital to keep up the necessary pace of investment.
Stronger oil company partnerships could bring mutual benefits
Major structural changes are underway in the upstream oil and gas industry, with 
the national  companies  playing  an  increasingly  dominant  role.  In  the  Reference 
Scenario, they account for about 80% of total incremental production of both oil and gas 
between 2007 and 2030. In most of the countries with the largest oil and gas reserves, 
national companies dominate the upstream industry and foreign companies are either 
not allowed to own and develop reserves or are subject to tight restrictions. Higher 
oil prices and a growing conviction among political leaders that national companies 
serve the nation’s interests better than private and foreign oil companies have boosted 
the  confidence  and  aspirations  of  national  companies,  some  of  them  rivalling  the 
international companies for technical capability and efficiency. The international oil 
companies, which have traditionally dominated the global oil and gas industry, are 
increasingly being squeezed by the growing power of the national companies and by 
dwindling reserves and production in accessible mature basins outside OPEC countries. 
The super-majors have been struggling to replace their proven reserves and expand 
production, while the share of their cash earnings that is returned to shareholders has 
been growing. 
How the structure of the global oil and gas industry evolves in the coming decades 
will have important implications for investment, production capacity and prices. 
The increasing dominance of national companies may make it less certain that the 
investment projected in this Outlook will actually be made. The long-term policies 
of some major resource-rich countries in support of national goals may lead to slower 
depletion of their resources. Although some national companies, like Saudi Aramco, 
perform strongly in most areas, others may be less well placed to address the financing, 
technical and managerial challenges of bringing new upstream capacity on stream. 
Partnerships  between  the  national  and  international  companies  could  help  address 
these challenges. The mutual benefits that could accrue are compelling: the national 
companies control most of the world’s remaining reserves, but some lack the technology 
and skilled personnel to do much more than simply maintain existing producing assets; 
the international companies are opportunity-constrained, but have the management 
skills and technology to help national companies develop their reserves.

Executive summary 45
Oil-rich African countries have no excuse for their citizens’ energy 
poverty 
A number of sub-Saharan African countries hold large oil and gas resources, which are 
expected to underpin strong growth in their production and exports in the coming 
two decades or so. Conventional oil production in the ten largest hydrocarbon-producing 
countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  reached  5.6 mb/d  in  2007,  of  which  5.1 mb/d  was 
exported. In the Reference Scenario, output rises to 7.4 mb/d and oil exports to 6.4 mb/d 
in 2030. Gas production in these countries increases more than four-fold, from 36 billion 
cubic metres in 2006 to 163 bcm in 2030, with most of the increase going to export. 
These projections hinge on a reduction in gas flaring, adequate investment and avoiding 
disruptions to supplies through civil unrest. Cumulative government revenues from oil and 
gas output (from royalties and taxes) in these ten countries are projected, in aggregate, 
to total $4 trillion over 2007-2030. Nigeria and Angola remain the largest exporters, with 
combined cumulative government revenues of about $3.5 trillion. Taxes on oil and gas 
production account for more than 50% of total government revenues in most of the oil- and 
gas-rich sub-Saharan African countries.
Despite the vast hydrocarbon wealth of these ten countries, most of their citizens 
remain poor. As a result, household use of modern energy services is very limited. Two-
thirds of households do not have access to electricity and three-quarters do not have 
access to clean fuels for cooking, relying instead on fuelwood and charcoal. Unless there 
are major government initiatives to address this problem, the number of electricity-
deprived people is projected to increase over the projection period, as the population 
grows. And more than half of the total population of these countries still relies on 
fuelwood and charcoal for cooking in 2030. 
Tackling  energy  poverty  is  well  within  these  countries’  means,  but  major 
institutional reforms are needed. We estimate the capital cost of providing minimal 
energy services (electricity and liquefied petroleum gas stoves and cylinders) to these 
households over the Outlook period to be about $18 billion. This is equivalent to only 
0.4%  of  cumulative  government  revenues  from  oil  and  gas.  An  improvement  in  the 
efficiency and transparency of revenue allocation and the accountability of governments 
in the use of public funds would improve the likelihood that oil and gas revenues are 
actually used to alleviate poverty generally and energy poverty specifically.  
The consequences for the global climate of policy inaction
are shocking
The projected rise in emissions of greenhouse gases in the Reference Scenario puts 
us on a course of doubling the concentration of those gases in the atmosphere by 
the end of this century, entailing an eventual global average temperature increase 
of up to 6°C. The Reference Scenario trends point to continuing growth in emissions of 
CO
2
 and other greenhouse gases. Global energy-related CO
2
 emissions rise from 28 Gt 
in 2006 to 41 Gt in 2030 — an increase of 45%. The 2030 projection is only 1 Gt lower 
than that projected in last year’s Outlook, even though we assume much higher prices 
and slightly lower world GDP growth. World greenhouse-gas emissions, including non-

energy CO
2
 and all other gases, are projected to grow from 44 Gt CO
2
-equivalent in 
2005 to 60 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030, an increase of 35% over 2005. 
Three-quarters of the projected increase in energy-related CO
2
 emissions in the 
Reference Scenario arises in China, India and the Middle East, and 97% in non-OECD 
countries as a whole. On average, however, non-OECD per-capita emissions remain 
far lower than those in the OECD. Emissions in the OECD reach a peak after 2020 and 
then decline. Only in Europe and Japan are emissions in 2030 lower than today. The 
bulk of the increase in global energy-related CO
2
 emissions is expected to come from 
cities, their share rising from 71% in 2006 to 76% in 2030 as a result of urbanisation. City 
residents tend to consume more energy than rural residents, so they therefore emit 
more CO
2
 per capita.
The road from Copenhagen must be paved with more than good 
intentions 
Strong, co-ordinated action is needed urgently to curb the growth in greenhouse-
gas emissions and the resulting rise in global temperatures. The post-2012 global 
climate-change policy regime that is expected to be established at the Copenhagen 
conference in 2009 will provide the international framework for that action. With 
energy-related CO
2
 accounting for 61% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the energy 
sector will have to be at the heart of discussions on what level of concentration to 
aim for and how to achieve it. The target that is set for the long-term stabilisation of 
greenhouse-gas concentration will determine the pace of the required transformation 
of the global energy system, as well as how stringent the policy responses will need 
to be. Successfully meeting that target will hinge on effective implementation.
The choice of global emissions trajectory will need to take into account technological 
requirements and costs in the energy sector. The normal cycle of capital replacement 
is a key constraint on the speed with which low-carbon technologies can enter into use 
without incurring disproportionate cost. The energy sector has a relatively slow rate 
of capital replacement in general, due to the long lifetime of much of its capital — for 
producing, supply and using energy. As a result, more efﬁ cient technologies normally 
take many years to spread through the energy sector. It will be necessary to face up to 
the reality of the cost of early capital retirement if radical measures are to be taken to 
speed up this process so as to deliver deep cuts in emissions. The rate of capital-stock 
turnover is particularly slow in the power sector, where large up-front costs and long 
operating lifetimes mean that plants that have already been built — and their associated 
emissions — are effectively “locked-in”. In the Reference Scenario, three-quarters of the 
projected output of electricity worldwide in 2020 (and more than half in 2030) comes 
from power stations that are already operating today. As a result, even if all power plants 
built from now onwards were carbon-free, CO
2
 emissions from the power sector would 
still be only 25%, or 4 Gt, lower in 2020 relative to the Reference Scenario.
Any agreement will need to take into account the importance of a handful of major 
emitters. The ﬁ ve largest emitters of energy-related CO
2
 — China, the United States, 
the  European  Union,  India  and  Russia  —  together  account  for  almost  two  thirds  of 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Executive summary 47
global CO
2
 emissions; in the Reference Scenario, this proportion is expected to remain 
similar in 2020. The contributions to emissions reduction made by China and the United 
States will be critical to reaching a stabilisation goal. The scale of the reduction in 
energy-related emissions by country or region varies markedly with different levels of 
international participation. 
The stabilisation goal will determine the scale of the energy 
challenge
This Outlook considers two climate-policy scenarios corresponding to long-term 
stabilisation of greenhouse-gas concentration at 550 and 450 parts per million of 
CO
2
 equivalent. The 550 Policy Scenario equates to an increase in global temperature 
of approximately 3°C, the 450 Policy Scenario to a rise of around 2°C. The 550 Policy 
Scenario involves a plateauing of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020 and reductions soon 
after. The 450 Policy Scenarios involves much more substantial reductions after 2020. 
Even then, emissions overshoot the trajectory needed to meet the 450 ppm CO
2
-eq 
target,  requiring  greater  emissions  reductions  after  2030.  In  both  scenarios,  total 
emissions are significantly lower in 2030 in all major emitting countries. To reach either 
of these outcomes, hundreds of millions of households and businesses around the world 
would need to be encouraged to change the way they use energy. This will require 
innovative policies, an appropriate regulatory framework, the rapid development of a 
global carbon market and increased investment in energy research, development and 
demonstration.
There is a wide range of international policy mechanisms that could be adopted 
to meet an agreed climate objective. However, as current political debate shows, 
and given practical issues in the energy sector, the reality is that nations adopt the 
approach or approaches that best reflect their varied interests and capabilities. This 
Outlook analyses the implications for the energy sector of a hybrid policy framework 
involving one particular combination of cap-and-trade systems, sectoral agreements
(in the transport and industry sectors) and national policies and measures. Cap-and-
trade systems are assumed to play an important role in the OECD regions. The carbon 
price there reaches $90/tonne of CO
2
 in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario and $180/tonne 
in the 450 Policy Scenario. 
In the 550 Policy Scenario, world primary energy demand expands by about 32% 
between 2006 and 2030 with the share of fossil fuels falling markedly. Demand 
grows on average by 1.2% per year, compared with 1.6% in the Reference Scenario. By 
2030, demand is 9% lower than in the Reference Scenario, mainly as a result of efficiency 
gains. Global energy-related CO
2
 emissions peak in 2025 and then decline slightly to 
33 Gt in 2030, while greenhouse-gas emissions plateau by 2020 and are broadly flat 
through  to  2030.  Both  total  greenhouse-gas  and  energy-related  CO
2
  emissions  are 
19% lower in 2030 than in the Reference Scenario. The energy mix in this scenario is 
markedly different to that of the Reference Scenario, with fossil fuels losing market 
share to renewables and nuclear power. Oil demand rises to 98 mb/d in 2030 — almost 
9 mb/d less than in the Reference Scenario. More than half of the oil savings occur 
in the transport sector in OECD countries and other major economies, as a result of 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
48 World Energy Outlook 2008
sectoral  agreements  to  reduce  emissions  from  light-duty  vehicles  and  aviation.  Oil 
prices are around $100 per barrel (in year-2007 dollars) in 2030, 18% lower than in the 
Reference Scenario, due to lower demand. OPEC production still increases, to 49 mb/d 
in 2030, almost 13 mb/d higher than today (but 4 mb/d less than in the Reference 
Scenario). CCS is also deployed more quickly. In 2030, the installed capacity of CCS 
plants amounts to over 160 GW worldwide, of which about 70% is in OECD countries. 
CCS capacity is negligible in the Reference Scenario.
The 450 Policy Scenario assumes much stronger and broader policy action from 
2020  onwards,  inducing  quicker  development  and  deployment  of  low-carbon 
technologies. Global energy-related CO
2
 emissions are assumed to follow broadly the 
same trajectory as in the 550 Policy Scenario until 2020, and then to fall more quickly. 
They peak in 2020 at 32.5 Gt and then decline to 25.7 Gt in 2030. This scenario requires 
emissions in OECD countries to be reduced by almost 40% in 2030, compared with 2006 
levels. Other major economies are required to limit their emissions growth to 20%. 
Participation in an international cap-and-trade system is assumed to be broader than 
in the 550 Policy Scenario, covering all major emitting countries from 2020 onwards. 
Hydropower,  biomass,  wind  and  other  renewables  see  faster  deployment  in  power 
generation, accounting for 40% of total generation worldwide in 2030. An additional 
190 GW of CCS is deployed in the last decade of the projection period compared with 
the 550 Policy Scenario. 
The  scale  of  the  challenge  in  the  450  Policy  Scenario  is  immense:  the  2030 
emissions level for the world as a whole in this scenario is less than the level of 
projected emissions for non-OECD countries alone in the Reference Scenario. In 
other words, the OECD countries alone cannot put the world onto the path to 450-ppm 
trajectory, even if they were to reduce their emissions to zero. Even leaving aside any 
debate about the political feasibility of the 450 Policy Scenario, it is uncertain whether 
the  scale  of  the  transformation  envisaged  is  even  technically  achievable,  as  the 
scenario assumes broad deployment of technologies that have not yet been proven. The 
technology shift, if achievable, would certainly be unprecedented in scale and speed of 
deployment. Increased public and private spending on research and development in the 
near term would be essential to develop the advanced technologies needed to make 
the 450 Policy Scenario a reality.
Tackling climate change will require big shifts in spending 
The  profound  shifts  in  energy  demand  and  supply  in  the  two  climate-policy 
scenarios call for huge increases in spending on new capital stock, especially in 
power  plants  and  in  more  energy-efficient  equipment  and  appliances.  The  550 
Policy Scenario requires $4.1 trillion more investment in total between 2010 and 2030 
than in the Reference Scenario — equal on average to 0.24% of annual world GDP. Most 
of this goes to deploying and improving existing technologies. Investment in power 
plants is $1.2 trillion higher, with close to three-quarters of this additional capital 
going to OECD countries.  Additional expenditures on the demand side are even bigger. 
Most of the extra spending is by individuals, who have to pay more for more efficient 
cars, appliances and buildings. This extra cost amounts to $17 per person per year

on average throughout the world. But these investments are accompanied by large 
savings on energy bills. Improved energy efficiency lowers fossil-fuel consumption by 
a cumulative amount of 22 billion tonnes of oil equivalent over 2010-2030, yielding 
cumulative savings of over $7 trillion.
The additional up front expenditures on energy-related capital are, unsurprisingly, 
considerably  larger  in  the  450  Policy  Scenario.  An  additional  $2.4  trillion  needs
to be invested in low- or zero-carbon power-generation capacity and an additional 
$2.7 trillion invested in more energy-efficient equipment, appliances and buildings 
than  in  the  550  Policy  Scenario.  Together,  these  costs  equal  on  average  0.55%  of 
annual world GDP. These expenditures are particularly great during the last decade 
of the projection period, when CO
2
 emissions fall most rapidly and the marginal cost 
of abatement options rises sharply. Galvanising these investments would require clear 
price signals (including through a broad-based, efficient carbon market), appropriate 
fiscal incentives and well-targeted regulation. At $5.8 trillion, the cumulative savings 
on fuel bills are smaller than in the 550 Policy Scenario, because higher electricity 
prices offset the bigger energy savings. 
The energy future will be very different
For  all  the  uncertainties  highlighted  in  this  report,  we  can  be  certain  that  the 
energy world will look a lot different in 2030 than it does today. The world energy 
system will be transformed, but not necessarily in the way we would like to see. We 
can be confident of some of the trends highlighted in this report: the growing weight 
of China, India, the Middle East and other non-OECD regions in energy markets and in 
CO
2
 emissions; the rapidly increasing dominance of national oil companies; and the 
emergence of low-carbon energy technologies. And while market imbalances could 
temporarily cause prices to fall back, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the era 
of cheap oil is over. But many of the key policy drivers (not to mention other, external 
factors) remain in doubt. It is within the power of all governments, of producing and 
consuming  countries  alike,  acting  alone  or  together,  to  steer  the  world  towards  a 
cleaner, cleverer and more competitive energy system. Time is running out and the 
time to act is now.

Introduction 51
INTRODUCTION
Global energy at a crossroads 
Purpose and scope of the study
It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of human prosperity hinges on finding a 
way of supplying the world’s growing energy needs in a way that does not irreparably 
harm the environment. Until recently, it looked as if we had plenty of time to meet 
that  challenge.  No  longer.  Surging  oil  and  gas  prices  have  drawn  attention  to  the 
physical and political constraints on raising production — and the vital importance of 
affordable supplies to the world economy. And the latest scientific evidence suggests 
that the pace of climate change resulting from man-made emissions of greenhouse 
gases — the bulk of which come from burning fossil fuels — is faster than predicted. 
The urgent need for a veritable energy revolution, involving a wholesale global shift to 
low-carbon technologies, is now widely recognised. 
This  year’s  World  Energy  Outlook,  as  in  all  even-numbered  years,  provides  a 
comprehensive update of long-term energy demand and supply projections to 2030, 
fuel by fuel and region by region. As a special feature this year, it examines how energy 
is used in cities and the implications for the future. The Outlook also takes a detailed 
look at the two headline issues that emerge from these projections: the prospects for 
oil and gas production, and the policy options for tackling climate change after 2012, 
when a new global agreement is due to take effect. The results of these analyses are 
intended to provide policy makers, investors and end users with a rigorous quantitative 
framework  for  assessing  likely  future  trends  in  energy  markets  and  the  cost-
effectiveness of new policies to tackle energy-security and environmental concerns. 
Last year’s Outlook drew attention to the risk of an oil-supply crunch by the middle of 
the next decade, were upstream investment to fall short of requirements, triggering 
a jump in prices. The surge in oil prices over the past year reflects, in large part, 
market expectations that such a scenario is set to become reality. A growing number 
of  oil  companies  and  analysts  have  suggested  that  oil  production  may  peak  within 
the next two decades, as a result of limits on the amount of investment that can be 
mobilised, rising costs and political and geological factors. Limited exploration activity 
is increasing the uncertainties about finding new oilfields; and the rate of decline in 
production at existing fields — especially the large, mature fields that have been the 
mainstay of global output for several decades — is faster than many believe. How 
decline rates at these fields evolve — with or without the deployment of enhanced 
recovery techniques — will have major implications for the need to invest in new fields, 
which are typically smaller, more complex and more costly to develop. 
To shed light on these issues, this Outlook takes an in-depth look at the drivers of oil 
production, based on a detailed field-by-field analysis of production trends, investment 
and costs, and considers the opportunities for expanding capacity and the possible 
constraints and risks — both above and below ground. The aim is to support the cause of

52 World Energy Outlook 2008
more transparency in data on oil and gas reserves and production; and provide valuable 
insights into the adequacy of current investment plans and the prospects for expanding 
output in the longer term.
Worries  about  oil-supply  shortages  are  matched  by  long-term  concerns  about  the 
threat of rising fossil-energy use on the global climate. In most countries, climate-
change has risen to the top of the political agenda — the result of a growing body of 
evidence of actual global warming and ever-more startling predictions of the ecological 
consequences. Action in the energy sector, the major source of man-made greenhouse-
gas emissions, will be fundamental to meeting the climate-change challenge. Much 
depends  on  government  responses.  Past  editions  of  the  Outlook  showed  that  even 
if all the government policies and measures under discussion at that time had been 
implemented,  the  world  would  still  not  be  on  a  sustainable  path.  Since  the  last 
Outlook,  governments  have  adopted  significant  new  measures.  But  limiting  global 
warming to a maximum of 2°C will require a much bigger and co-ordinated global 
effort. Negotiations on an international agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol are 
scheduled to end in 2009 with a meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen. This year’s report aims to 
inform and support the climate negotiations by presenting information and analysis of 
a combination of policy options and approaches available to policy makers and their 
implications for the energy sector. 
Methodology
As in previous Outlooks, a scenario approach is used to examine future energy trends. 
The projection period runs to 2030. The projections are derived from a large-scale 
mathematical  model,  the  World  Energy  Model  (WEM),  which  has  been  completely 
overhauled  and  updated,  drawing  on  the  most  recent  historical  data  and  revised 
assumptions.  The  core  projections,  the  Reference  Scenario,  indicate  what  would 
happen if, among other things, there were to be no new energy-policy interventions 
by governments beyond those already adopted by mid-2008. This will not happen and 
the Reference Scenario is not a forecast: it is a baseline picture of how global energy 
markets would evolve if the underlying trends in energy demand and supply are not 
changed.  This  allows  us  to  test  alternative  assumptions  about  future  government 
policies. Additional scenarios and cases are included in the analyses of oil-production 
prospects and climate-policy options, as described below. 
Oil and gas supply prospects
A central pillar of our analysis of the prospects for oil production to 2030 is a detailed 
field-by-field assessment of the production outlook for the world’s largest oilfields 
currently in production, the biggest of which, in most cases, have been in operation 
for many years. The analysis covers around 800 oilfields. To our knowledge, this is the 
most detailed and comprehensive study of its kind that has ever been made public. 
The work also involved a bottom-up assessment of near-term investment plans and 
capacity additions at existing and new oil and gas fields, based on the compilation 
of detailed project-by-project and company-by-company data. In recognition of the

Introduction 53
uncertainties surrounding the outlook for sustaining oil production at existing fields 
and fields that will be developed in the future, we have modelled the sensitivity of 
production to different production-decline rates and drawn out the implications for 
upstream investment and international oil markets.  
This  analysis  also  considers  the  prospects  for  further  advances  in  upstream 
technologies, the potential for improved and enhanced recovery techniques to bolster 
conventional oil and gas output and recovery rates, and the prospects for producing 
oil and gas from non-conventional sources. It also looks at the factors that may hinder 
capital flows to the upstream industry and capacity additions — including limitations on 
the opportunities for the international oil companies to invest in developing reserves 
in many key resource-rich countries and the willingness and ability of the resource-rich 
countries and their national companies to expand capacity. Higher prices have driven 
up the revenues earned by oil and gas exporters, which may paradoxically reduce the 
incentive for some countries to expand capacity in the medium term — partly because 
of limits on the rate at which they can absorb the additional earnings. The implications 
for the relationships between international oil companies, national companies and oil 
services providers are also assessed.
As a special focus, we also look at the outlook for oil and gas production in ten oil- and 
gas-exporting sub-Saharan African countries, the revenues it will generate and the 
prospects for energy poverty. It is well established that the reasons for the persistence 
of  poverty  in  resource-exporting  countries  are  mismanagement  of  hydrocarbon 
revenues, poor governance and a lack of transparency. This study shows what could 
be  achieved  to  end  reliance  on  traditional  biomass  and  provide  general  access  to 
electricity by calculating the investment costs associated with increasing energy access 
and comparing them with total government revenues from hydrocarbon exploitation. 
Climate change scenarios
We  examine  in  detail,  through  scenario  analysis,  how  different  international 
agreements and national/regional commitments on climate change could affect the 
evolution of energy markets after 2012. The analysis focuses on three of the most 
commonly  discussed  elements  of  a  post-2012  climate  framework,  namely  cap-and-
trade,  international  sectoral  agreements  and  national  policies  and  measures.  A 
plausible combination of these mechanisms, or hybrid approach, is modelled, using 
the  WEM,  in  two  scenarios:  one  in  which  it  is  agreed  to  limit  the  greenhouse-gas 
concentration in the atmosphere to 550 ppm (in CO
2
-equivalent terms) and another in 
which the concentration is held to 450 ppm. 
The mix of approaches differs between three groups of countries: “OECD+” countries 
(a group that includes the OECD and non-OECD EU countries), “Other Major Economies” 
(including  China,  Russia,  India,  Indonesia,  Brazil  and  Middle  East)  and  “Other 
Countries”. A cap-and-trade system, similar in concept to the Emissions Trading Scheme 
that is currently operating in the European Union, is assumed to be implemented by 
the  OECD+  countries  in  the  550  Policy  Scenario  and  in  the  Other  Major  Economies 
too in the 450 Policy Scenario. The system is assumed to cover power generation and 
the industrial sector. The Other Major Economies are assumed to introduce national 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
54 World Energy Outlook 2008
policies  and  measures  covering  power  generation  and  industry,  aimed  generally  at 
improving energy security and mitigating local pollution, as well as helping to reduce 
CO
2
 emissions. In addition, to limit the risk of carbon leakage from countries covered 
by the cap-and-trade system, sector-specific energy-efficiency standards are assumed 
to be introduced in a number of industrial sectors. Achieving abatement of emissions in 
these countries is essential to meet ambitious climate targets, so these countries must 
have strong incentives to act, even for the 550 ppm objective to be met. 
We have assumed that international sectoral agreements are adopted and implemented 
in the transport and industry sectors in OECD+ and Other Major Economies. Such an 
approach is already being taken by the European Union, which currently excludes road 
transport from its emissions-trading scheme and is instead negotiating vehicle fuel-
efficiency standards and renewable fuel mandates. In the buildings sector, it is assumed 
that all countries undertake national policies and measures tailored to the national 
potential  for  energy  savings.  These  could  require  formal  international  approval.  It 
is assumed that the least-developed countries with low per-capita emissions are not 
required to play any part in a cap-and-trade system or adopt sectoral agreements. 
Nonetheless, they do act to limit emissions through national policies and measures, and 
have opportunities to earn emission credits under the Clean Development Mechanism 
and gain access to global technology or financing programmes.

PREFACE
Higher  energy  prices  and  slower  economic  growth  have  left  their  mark  on  the 
assumptions for this year’s World Energy Outlook. As a result, energy growth to 2030 
is slower than in WEO-2007, though other trends are broadly unchanged – persistent 
dominance of fossil fuels in the energy mix (despite additional action taken in the last 
twelve months to mitigate climate change), an inexorable rise in CO
2 
emissions and a 
strongly rising share for developing countries in global energy consumption: almost all 
the increase in fossil fuel consumption over the period occurs in non-OECD countries.
Following the pattern which will be familiar to regular WEO readers, this first part 
of the book, Part A, sets out in detail this year’s world energy projections in the 
Reference Scenario. The main assumptions underpinning these projections are set out 
in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 summarises the global trends in energy demand and supply, 
as well as the implications for investment. The detailed projections for oil, gas, coal, 
electricity and renewables are then set out in Chapters 3-7.
In an innovation this year, Chapter 8 examines the special place of urban energy 
consumption in global usage. By 2030, urban use accounts for nearly three-quarters of 
total energy use worldwide.

CHAPTER 1
H I G H L I G H T S
CONTEXT AND PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS
The Reference Scenario embodies the effects of those government policies and   z
measures that were enacted or adopted by mid-2008, even though many of them 
have not yet been fully implemented. Possible, potential or even likely future 
policy actions are not taken into account. Many countries subsidise energy, in 
some cases heavily. Most have policies to phase out subsidies, and are accordingly 
assumed to reduce them progressively.
World population is assumed to grow at an annual average rate of 1%, from an   z
estimated  6.5  billion  in  2006  to  8.2  billion  in  2030.  Population  growth  slows 
progressively  over  the  projection  period,  in  line  with  past  trends:  population 
expanded  by  1.4%  per  year  from  1990  to  2006.  The  population  of  non-OECD 
countries as a group continues to grow most rapidly.
The rate of growth in world GDP — the main driver of energy demand in all   z
regions — is assumed to average 3.3% per year over the period 2006-2030. It 
averaged 3.2% from 1990 to 2006. The increase reflects the rising weight in the 
world economy of the non-OECD countries, where growth will remain fastest. The 
average growth rate nonetheless falls progressively over the projection period, 
from 4.2% in 2006-2015 to 2.8% in 2015-2030. Growth remains highest in China, 
India  and the Middle East.
The IEA crude oil import price, a proxy for international prices, is assumed to   z
average $100 per barrel in real year-2007 dollars over the period 2008-2015 and 
then to rise in a broadly linear manner to over $120 in 2030. This represents a 
major upward adjustment from last year’s Outlook, reflecting higher prices for 
near-term physical delivery and for futures contracts, as well as a reassessment 
of the prospects for the cost of oil supply and the outlook for demand. In nominal 
terms, prices double to just over $200 per barrel in 2030.  
Natural  gas  prices  are  assumed  to  rise  in  2008  and  then  to  fall  back  slightly   z
through to 2010 in lagged adjustment to oil prices. Gas prices begin to rise after 
2015 in line with oil prices. Coal prices, which have also risen sharply in recent 
years, are assumed to settle at around $120 per tonne in 2010, remaining flat 
through to 2015 and then falling back slightly to $110 in 2030.
The average energy efficiency of equipment currently in use is generally assumed   z
to  improve  progressively  over  the  projection  period,  though  at  varying  rates 
according to the type of equipment and the rate of retirement and replacement 
of  the  stock  of  capital.  Some  major  new  supply-side  technologies,  including 
carbon  capture  and  storage,  second-generation  biofuels  and  coal-to-liquids, 
are assumed to be deployed on a small scale before the end of the projection 
period.

Government policies and measures
As in previous editions of the World Energy Outlook, the Reference Scenario, the results 
of which are set out in Part A, takes into consideration all government policies and 
measures that were enacted or adopted by the middle of the current year, including 
those that have not yet been fully implemented. The policies considered cover a wide 
array of sectors and a variety of instruments. Some measures not directly addressed at 
the energy sector nonetheless have important consequences for energy markets and 
have been taken into account. Most recent policy initiatives directed at the energy 
sector, in both OECD and non-OECD countries, are designed to improve energy security, 
combat climate change and address other environmental problems through improved 
energy efficiency, switching to lower carbon fuels and enhanced indigenous energy 
production.  They  include  the  Energy  Independence  and  Security  Act  in  the  United 
States and the European Commission’s climate action plan (the provisions of which 
are taken into account in the Reference Scenario), which includes a binding target to 
raise the share of renewable energy in the European Union’s  primary consumption 
to 20% by 2030 (Table 1.1). The impact on energy demand and supply of recently 
adopted measures does not show up in historical market data, which are available only 
up to 2006 for all countries (preliminary data for 2007 is to hand for OECD countries). 
Some policies adopted earlier are not yet fully implemented but have been taken into 
account in the Reference Scenario.

Importantly,  the  Reference  Scenario  does  not  include  possible,  potential  or  even 
likely future policy initiatives. For that reason, the projections in this scenario cannot 
be  considered  forecasts  of  what  is  likely  to  happen.  Rather,  they  should  be  seen 
as a baseline vision of how energy markets are likely to develop should government 
policy making develop no further. Major new energy-policy initiatives will inevitably 
be implemented during the projection period, but it is impossible to predict exactly 
which  measures  will  eventually  be  adopted  in  each  country  and  how  they  will  be 
implemented, especially towards the end of the projection period. The climate-policy 
scenarios set out in Part C analyse the impact of a range of possible future policy 
interventions.
Box 1.1 z  Improvements to the modelling framework in 
WEO-2008
The IEA’s World Energy Model (WEM) — a large-scale mathematical construct 
designed to replicate how energy markets function — is the main tool used to 
generate the sector-by-sector and fuel-by-fuel projections by region or country 
for  all  the  scenarios  in  this  Outlook. 1   The  model,  which  has  been  developed 
over several years, comprises five main modules: final energy demand, power 
generation, refining and other transformation, investment and carbon-dioxide 
(CO 2
) emissions, all of which are modelled on a country or regional basis; and 
fossil-fuel and biofuels supply, which is modelled by major producer. This year, 
all the WEM modules were overhauled and major new elements were introduced, 
including the following:
The  demand  module  for  all  regions  was  completely  rebuilt,  involving   z
re-estimating parameters using more recent time-series data and introducing 
more detailed coverage of demand by sector and fuel.
The oil and gas production and trade models were expanded to take better   z
account of economic variables and to reflect the recent surge in cost inflation 
and the fall in the value of the US dollar against most other currencies. 
Oilfield decline rates were analysed in detail on a field-by-field basis in order   z
to assess the prospects for future decline rates (see Chapter 10).
Biofuels demand was modelled in more detail, taking account of technical and   z
economic factors.
Power-generation  capital  and  operating  costs  were  assessed  in  detail  and   z
the cost assumptions in the WEM were revised to take account of recent cost 
inflation (see Chapter 6).
In addition, the integration of the WEM into a general equilibrium model, started 
in 2007, was taken a step further, in order to model more precisely the feedback 
links between energy markets and the macro-economy.

62 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Although the Reference Scenario assumes the implementation of currently adopted 
energy and environmental policies during the projection period, how those policies are 
implemented in practice is nonetheless assumed to vary by fuel and by country. For 
example, while nuclear energy is assumed to remain an option for power generation in 
those countries that have not officially banned it or decided to phase it out (though not 
for others), the pace of construction of new plants differs among countries, reflecting 
differences in the degree of commitment to that energy source. 
Pricing and other market reforms are also assumed to be implemented at different rates. 
In most non-OECD countries, at least one fuel or form of energy continues to be subsidised, 
most often through price controls that hold the retail or wholesale price below the true 
market level. Other forms of direct financial intervention by government, such as grants, 
tax rebates or deductions and soft loans, are commonplace. Indirect interventions also 
occur, such as the free provision of energy infrastructure and services. Some of these 
interventions are more justified than others; for example, support to overcome market 
obstacles  to  the  development  and  deployment  of  new  technology.  According  to  our 
calculations, 2   energy-related  consumption  subsidies,  which  encourage  consumption  by 
pricing  energy  below  market  levels,  amounted  in  20  non-OECD  countries  (accounting 
for over 80% of total non-OECD primary energy demand) to about $310 billion in 2007 
(Figure 1.1). Oil products account for one-half, or $150 billion. Most of these countries 
do  have  policies  eventually  to  phase  out  consumption  subsidies  and  we  accordingly 
assume that these subsidies are gradually reduced, though at varying rates across regions. 
Consumption subsidies are minimal in OECD countries. In all cases, the rates of ad valorem 
taxes and excise duties on fuels are assumed to remain unchanged.

Chapter 1 - Context and principal assumptions
Population
Population growth affects the size and composition of energy demand, directly and 
through its impact on economic growth and development. Our population assumptions 
are  drawn  from  the  most  recent  United  Nations  projections  (UNPD,  2007a).  World 
population  is  projected  to  grow  from  an  estimated  6.5  billion  in  2006  to  around 
8.2 billion  in  2030  —  an  average  rate  of  increase  of  1%  per  year  (Figure  1.2).  By 
2030, 52% of the world’s population will be in non-OECD Asia, down slightly from 53% 
today. China will remain the world’s most heavily populated country, with more than 
1.46 billion people, though India’s population all but reaches China’s by 2030. The 
OECD’s share of global population is set to slide further, from 18% today to less than 
16% in 2030.

The emerging economies will continue to experience the fastest rate of population 
growth. The population of non-OECD countries in total is projected to grow by 1.1% 
per year, against 0.4% per year in the OECD (Table 1.2). The population of all regions 
expands, with the exception of OECD Pacific, largely due to Japan, where population is 
projected to fall by 0.3% per year, and Eastern Europe/Eurasia, largely due to Russia, 
where population slides by 0.6% per year. By 2030, Russia’s population is expected to 
be 13% smaller than today. Most of the growth in the OECD population comes from 
North America. Several European countries, including Germany and Italy, are expected 
to experience significant population declines. All regions will experience continued 
ageing in the coming decades as fertility and mortality rates decline. Worldwide, the 
proportion of people over 60 years old is projected to rise from 11% now to about 15% 
by 2030 (UNPD, 2007b). This will have far-reaching economic and social consequences, 
which will inevitably affect both the level and pattern of energy use. Older people, for 
example, tend to travel less for work and leisure. 
All of the increase in world population in aggregate will occur in urban areas: the rural 
population is expected to start to decline in about a decade. In 2008, for the first time 
in history, the urban population will equal the rural population of the world; from 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
then on, the greater part of the world population will be urban (UNPD, 2007c). Major 
parts of the world, particularly in Africa, will remain largely rural. Continuing rapid 
urbanisation in non-OECD countries will have a major impact on demand for modern 
energy, the bulk of which is consumed in or close to towns and cities (see Chapter 8).

Economic growth
Economic  growth  is  by  far  the  most  important  determinant  of  the  overall  demand 
for energy services. The pattern of economic development also affects the fuel mix. 
As a result, the energy projections in the Outlook are highly sensitive to underlying 
assumptions about rates and patterns of economic growth. Extremely rapid economic 
expansion in many countries outside the OECD — especially in Asia – is the main reason 
why  energy  demand  has  accelerated  in  recent  years.  Nonetheless,  over  the  long 
term, the income elasticity of energy demand — the change in demand relative to the 
change in GDP – has fallen in most parts of the world, though it has picked up since the 
start of the current decade. Between 1971 and 1990, each 1% increase in global GDP 
(in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms) was accompanied by a 0.66% increase in 
primary energy consumption. 3  Between 1990 and 2000, the corresponding increase in 
demand dropped to only 0.44%, but it rebounded to 0.68% in 2000-2006, largely due to 
an increase in the energy intensity of China’s economic growth.

There are strong signs that the global economy, which has expanded briskly in recent 
years, is slowing, partly as a consequence of higher energy and other commodity prices 
and the financial crisis that began in 2007. GDP growth has already fallen in most OECD 
economies, particularly in the United States, where a slump in the housing market has 
contributed to the credit squeeze, the consequences of which are being felt throughout 
the global financial system. Many OECD countries are now on the verge of recession. 
Most non-OECD countries have so far been less affected by financial market turbulence 
and have continued to grow rapidly, led by China, India and the Middle East (where 
growth has been boosted by surging oil-export revenues). This momentum is provided 
by strong productivity gains as these countries progressively integrate into the global 
economy, by improved terms of trade for commodity producers on the back of soaring 
prices for oil and other raw materials and by policy improvements. But there are signs 
that activity in developing Asian countries, too, is now beginning to slow. Headline 
inflation has increased around the world, especially in the emerging economies, with 
surging food and energy prices. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects world GDP in PPP terms to drop sharply 
from an above-trend 5% in 2006 and 2007 to 4.1% in 2008 and 3.9% in 2009. 4  It projects 
inflation to rise from 2.2% in 2007 to 3.4% in 2008 in the advanced economies (essentially 
those of the OECD) and from 6.4% to 9.1% in the emerging economies. Trade in goods 
and services is expected to slow. GDP growth in all regions is expected to fall, though 
non-OECD countries will continue to outpace the remainder of the world. In the United 
States, growth is projected to fall from 2.2% in 2007 to only 1.3% in 2008 and 0.8% in 
2009, while China’s growth falls from 11.9% to 9.7% in 2008 and 9.8% in 2009. 
The  continued  housing-market  correction  in  the  United  States,  similar  indications 
in Europe and other parts of the world, and the fall-out from the financial crisis are 
among the most obvious uncertainties surrounding the near-term economic outlook 
(IMF, 2008b). Further steep declines in asset prices and an abrupt reduction in the 
lending  capacity  of  the  banking  system  could  lead  to  a  global  credit  crunch,  with 
potentially severe consequences for growth. Although the IMF judges the risks to its 
projections to be greater on the downside, there is some potential for an unexpectedly 
rapid recovery among the rich industrialised economies in 2009 if conditions in financial 
markets improve, lowering the current high price of credit (OECD, 2008). 
This Outlook assumes that economic growth will recover to around 4.5% per year by the 
turn of the decade, but will slow progressively through to 2030. World GDP is assumed 
to grow by an average of 3.3% per year over the period 2006-2030 compared with 3.2% 
from 1990 to 2006 (Table 1.3). The increase reflects the rising weight in the world 
economy of the non-OECD countries, where growth will remain fastest. GDP growth is 
assumed to average 4.2% per year in 2006-2015 and 2.8% per year in 2015-2030. Growth 
is nonetheless somewhat lower than assumed in last year’s Outlook, especially in OECD 
countries, in part because of the impact of higher energy prices and weaker prospects 
for global economic growth in the near term.

Note: The regional aggregate growth rates are calculated based on GDP expressed in purchasing-power parity 
terms. These assumptions also apply to the climate-policy scenarios described in Part C.
These GDP assumptions take account of recent major revisions to PPPs, which lower 
the weight of China and other developing countries in global GDP, and explain in part 
the reduction in average GDP growth for the world over the projection period (Box 1.2). 
The economies of many regions are expected to shift away from energy-intensive heavy 
manufacturing towards lighter industries and services, though the pace of this process, 
which is well advanced in the OECD and some emerging economies, varies. Industrial 
production continues to grow in volume terms. 
China and India are expected to continue to grow faster than other regions, followed 
by the Middle East. China is assumed to grow at 6.1% per year between 2006 and 2030, 
the second-highest rate in the world. India, which grows fastest at 6.4% per year on 
average, overtakes China as the fastest-growing major country in the 2020s, reflecting 
its more rapid population growth and its earlier stage in the development process. 
The growth rates of the economies of China, India and other emerging economies are 
expected to slow as they mature. Middle East countries also grow relatively quickly, 
supported by buoyant oil revenues. GDP growth is assumed to temper gradually in all 
three OECD regions in response to acute competition from the emerging economies 
and to the ageing and stabilisation or fall of the population (which will reduce the 
active  labour  force  in  most  countries).  North  America  is  expected  to  remain  the 
fastest growing OECD economy, partly due to its more rapidly expanding and relatively 
young population, though the rate of GDP growth is assumed to drop from an annual 
average of 2.9% in 1990-2006 to 2.2% per year over the Outlook period. Europe and 
the Pacific are expected to see the lowest GDP growth of any major region. Based on 
our population and GDP-growth assumptions, per-capita incomes grow most rapidly in 
China and India (Figure 1.3).

Chapter 1 - Context and principal assumptions
Box 1.2 z  Implications of new estimates of purchasing power parity
Purchasing power parities (PPPs) measure the amount of a given currency needed 
to buy the same basket of goods and services, traded and non-traded, as one 
unit of the reference currency — in this report, the US dollar. By adjusting for 
differences in price levels, PPPs can, in principle, provide a more reliable indicator 
than market exchange rates of the true level of economic activity globally or 
regionally. Conversions based on market exchange rates typically underestimate 
the value of domestic economic activity and the output of developing countries 
relative to the industrialised economies. PPP rates can deviate by a large amount 
from the market exchange rate between two currencies. It is important to take 
account of the true level of economic activity in analysing the main drivers of 
energy demand or comparing energy intensities among countries. 
In 2007, the World Bank released the results of a major update of PPP exchange 
rates,  carried  out  under  its  International  Comparison  Program  (World  Bank, 
2008).  As  a  result,  the  PPP  differences  with  market  exchange  rates  were 
reduced  for  a  number  of  countries,  most  importantly  China  and  India,  thus 
reducing their weights in global GDP. The PPP rates were increased for some 
other emerging countries, including oil exporters. Overall, the average annual 
rate of global GDP growth between 2000 and 2007 was revised downwards by 
around one-half of a percentage point. China still ranks as the world’s second-
largest economy, accounting for about 11% of world GDP in 2007, compared 
with about 16% using the old PPP rate. The share of the United States in global 
GDP has been revised up from 19% to 21%. In spite of these changes, it remains 
true that the emerging economies have recently been the main driver of global 
growth  in  PPP  terms,  led  by  China,  which  contributed  nearly  27%  to  global 
growth in 2007 (IMF, 2008a).

Energy prices 
Energy prices are an exogenous determinant of the demand for and supply of each 
fuel and energy carrier in the WEM. The assumed trajectories for international energy 
prices in the Reference Scenario, summarised in Table 1.4, are based on a top-down 
assessment of the prices that would be needed to encourage sufficient investment in 
supply to meet projected demand over the Outlook period. In other words, they are 
derived iteratively to ensure their consistency with the overall global balance of supply 
and demand. They should not be interpreted as forecasts. Although the price paths 
follow smooth trends, this should not be taken as a prediction of stable energy markets: 
prices will, in reality, certainly deviate widely at times from these assumed trends. 
International prices are used to derive average end-user pre-tax prices for oil, gas and 
coal in each WEO region. Tax rates and subsidies are taken into account in calculating 
final post-tax prices, which help to determine final energy demand. Final electricity 
prices are derived from changes in marginal power-generation costs. All prices are 
expressed in US dollars and assume no change in exchange rates.

represents  a  major  upward  adjustment  from  WEO-2007,  reflecting  to  a  large  degree 
higher prices for near-term physical delivery and for futures contracts out to the middle

The surge in oil prices since the end of 2003, and especially since the beginning of 2007, 
can legitimately be described as an oil shock, albeit a slow-motion one. The price of 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) — a leading benchmark crude — rose steadily from a low 
of $28 per barrel on average in September 2003 to $74 in July 2006, before falling back 
to $54 in January 2007. The price then resumed its upward path, hitting an intra-day 
peak of over $145 in July 2008 — an all-time record in both nominal and real terms. 
Prices rose on average in 41 of the 59 months between September 2003 and August 
2008, and in all but four of the 17 months since February 2007. Prices have, however, 
since fallen back substantially, to around $100 in mid-September 2008.
A crucial difference with the price shocks of the 1970s is that the latter were caused 
by supply disruptions, whereas the recent shock has resulted largely from a tightening 
of market conditions, as demand (particularly for middle distillates) outstripped the 
growth  in  installed  crude-production  and  oil-refining  capacity,  and  from  growing 
expectations of continuing supply-side constraints in the future — a risk highlighted in 
the Deferred Investment Scenario of past WEOs. Geopolitical factors, including civil 
strife  in  Nigeria  and  worries  over  Iran’s  nuclear  programme,  have  magnified  these 
upward pressures on prices. The role of speculation and the emergence of oil as an 
“asset class” for investors, especially in index commodity funds, remains unclear — 
partly because of a lack of information on real financial flows into the oil market 
6.  Other  organisations,  including  the  US  Department  of  Energy  and  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, have also recently revised their oil-price assumptions.

(see the Spotlight below). 8  In contrast, there is widespread agreement among analysts 
that oil prices have been bid up partly to hedge against the fall in the value of the US 
dollar — especially since 2007. Stripping out the currency impact since 2007 shows a 
close fit between oil prices and global balances. 9  The sudden drop in oil prices in August 
and early September 2008 – in the absence of any obvious major shift in demand or 
supply — lends support to the argument that financial investors have been playing a 
significant role in amplifying the impact of tighter market fundamentals on prices.
Rarely has the outlook for oil prices been more uncertain than now, in mid-September 
2008. We assume in our Reference Scenario that the prices reached in mid-2008 are, to 
some extent, the result of transient factors and that a downward correction in prices 
that began in August continues through to the end of the year – in part thanks to some 
easing of market fundamentals. Our near-term analysis of investment and new capacity 
additions (set out in Chapter 13) points to little change in the balance in oil supply 
and demand through to the middle of the next decade; that is, projected increases in 
installed capacity are likely to be broadly matched by rising demand in the Reference 
Scenario, assuming investment is sustained beyond the end of the current decade. 
However, pronounced short-term swings in prices are likely to remain the norm and 
temporary price spikes or collapses cannot be ruled out. Prices are likely to remain 
highly volatile, especially in the next year or two. A worsening of the current financial 
crisis would most likely depress economic activity and, therefore, oil demand, exerting 
downward pressure on prices. On the other hand, any weakening of the dollar would 
help support prices. Beyond 2015, we assume that rising marginal costs of supply exert 
upward pressure on prices through to the end of the projection period. 
There are acute risks to these assumptions on both sides: a continuing surge in demand, 
under-investment  in  oil-production  or  refining  capacity,  or  a  large  and  sustained 
supply disruption could result in higher prices. A further slide in the dollar could also 
push prices up in dollar terms (assuming no change in exchange rates). Yet a slump in 
demand — possibly caused by recession and more rapid oil-price subsidy reform than we 
assume — together with faster than expected growth in investment could drive prices 
down below our assumed level. 
The assumption that governments implement policies to reduce subsidies (see above) 
has important implications for final oil prices to end users. 10  In 2007, most of the growth 
in world oil demand came from countries where oil-product prices are subsidised. In 
many countries, subsidies have risen sharply when governments have failed to increase 
regulated retail and wholesale prices as quickly as international prices. Iran, where 
retail oil prices are far below international levels, is an extreme example: the cost of 
those subsidies is estimated at $36 billion in 2007. Some countries, especially in Asia, 
8. An IEA Expert Roundtable in March 2008 discussed the many inﬂ uences on the current oil price. A wide 
range of views on the effects of money ﬂ ows on the oil market was expressed, but no agreement was 
reached  on  the  extent  to  which  those  ﬂ ows  affect  prices.  In  the  IEA’s  opinion,  the  limited  information 
available makes it impossible to account meaningfully for the cross-market interactions that routinely take 
place between different futures exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Gaps in market as well as 
ﬁ nancial data obscure the real drivers of prices.

Chapter 1 - Context and principal assumptions
are now starting to rein in subsidies in the face of the mounting burden on government 
budgets, worries about their impact on incentives for refiners and importers to supply 
local markets and the prospect of persistently high prices in the medium term. Several 
countries,  including  China,  India,  Malaysia  and  Indonesia,  increased  prices  in  the 
first half of 2008, but some are now considering cutting them again, with the drop in 
international prices.
Are speculators to blame for soaring oil prices?
As is often the case when the price of any commodity jumps, the finger of blame 
for the recent surge in oil prices has been pointed squarely at speculators. The 
amount of money invested in commodity funds has certainly risen strongly in recent 
years –20-fold since 2003 to more than $250 billion on some estimates. A growing 
number of analysts believe that this represents a speculative bubble rather than 
the outcome of market fundamentals. Several governments, including that of India, 
have called for restrictions on speculation to be imposed. 
But it is far from certain that the flow of money into oil trading has, in itself, 
driven  up  prices.  Speculators,  or  financial  investors,  play  both  sides  of  the 
market, and what they buy, they eventually must sell (unless they take delivery 
and store physical oil, which is rare) and vice versa. Each barrel of oil that is 
bought for future delivery on the futures market must be sold on before the 
contract expires. Whatever the volume of futures trading (and there is no limit 
to the number of “paper” barrels that can be bought and sold), no oil is actually 
kept off the market. The amount of money currently invested in index funds is 
large in absolute terms, but pales beside the estimated $50 trillion-worth of 
contracts of all types traded on futures exchanges and over-the-counter spot 
markets in 2007. 
Indeed, more speculative money left the regulated oil market than entered it 
over the first half of 2008. By mid-year, the scale of net long positions (that 
is, a commitment to buy at some point in the future) held by non-commercial 
participants in futures exchanges was roughly the same as it was in July 2007, 
when prices were little more than half as high. Moreover, the recent tightening 
of credit conditions has reduced liquidity in the world’s financial system, which 
arguably helped fuel the speculative inflows into oil futures in previous years. 
In  the  end,  virtually  the  only  buyers  of  physical  crude  oil  are  refiners,  and 
their needs have continued to rise with robust end-use demand, especially for 
middle distillates. The fact that in recent months stocks have barely risen above 
average levels of the past five years suggests that supply has only just managed 
to keep pace with demand. Thus, physical market fundamentals appear to have 
played the leading role in driving up prices, though financial investors may have 
amplified the impact.

72 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Natural gas prices
Natural gas prices have remained strongly linked to oil prices, either directly through 
indexation  clauses  in  long-term  supply  contracts  or  indirectly  through  competition 
between gas and oil products in power generation and end-use markets. Thus, the 
prices of gas traded internationally and locally on open markets around the world have 
risen sharply in recent years with oil prices, though price differentials can fluctuate 
sharply. 11  Although only a small share of world gas is traded between regions, the links 
between oil and gas markets mean that regional gas prices tend to move in parallel. 
Lags in long-term contracts, which still account for a large share of the gas traded 
outside North America, mean that gas prices have not yet fully reflected the increase in 
oil prices. That is the main reason why gas prices have generally risen less rapidly than 
oil prices since the beginning of the current decade (Figure 1.5). Gas prices on average 
in early 2008 were highest in North America, where most gas is traded on short-term 
markets and few lags exist, but prices had fallen back sharply by mid-year, reflecting 
a surge in production, weak demand and rising stocks. 
In  our  Reference  Scenario,  gas  prices  jump  in  all  three  regions  in  2008  and  then  fall 
back slightly through to 2010 in lagged response to the fall in oil prices from their mid-
2008 peaks. Prices begin to rise after 2015 in line with oil prices. Although the gradual 
development  of  gas-to-gas  competition  is  expected  to  weaken  the  contractual  links 
between oil and gas prices over the projection period, gas prices are not expected to fall 
relative to oil prices. Competition would be expected to exert some downward pressure 
on the prices of gas relative to those of oil. This is assumed to be offset by rising marginal 
supply costs for gas as the distances over which gas has to be transported, by pipeline or 
as liquefied natural gas (LNG) increase. The growing share of LNG in global gas supply and 
increasing opportunities for short-term trading of LNG are expected to contribute to a 
modest degree of convergence in regional prices over the projection period.

Chapter 1 - Context and principal assumptions
Steam coal prices
International steam coal prices have surged in recent years. The average price of coal 
imported by OECD countries jumped from $42 per tonne in 2003 to $73 in 2007 (in year-
2007 dollars) and soared to well over $100 in the first half of 2008. 12  Rising industrial 
production and electricity demand, especially in China, have boosted coal use. Higher 
gas prices have also encouraged some power stations and industrial end users to switch 
to coal and to invest in new coal-fired equipment. These factors have added to the 
upward pressure on coal demand and prices. 
Coal prices are assumed to settle at around $120 per tonne in real terms in 2010. 
Thereafter, prices are assumed to remain flat through to 2015 and then to fall back 
slightly to $110 in 2030 as new mining and transportation capacity becomes available. 
As oil and gas prices are assumed to rise steadily after 2015, coal becomes increasingly 
competitive – at least in countries not actively seeking to limit CO 2  emissions. In reality, 
the possibility of a carbon value being introduced or increasing where it already exists, 
together with a tightening of other environmental regulations, is likely to affect the use 
of coal in all regions, or to increase the cost of using it, counterbalancing the impact on 
coal demand of relatively lower prices.
Technology
Technological innovation and the rate of deployment of new technologies for supplying 
or  using  energy  have  a  major  impact  on  energy  balances,  both  in  terms  of  the 
overall amount of energy used and the fuel mix. Our projections are, therefore, very 
sensitive to assumptions about technological developments. In general, it is assumed 
in the Reference Scenario that the performance of currently available technologies 
improves  on  various  operational  criteria,  including  energy  efficiency.  High  energy 
prices are expected to contribute to this. However, our assumptions about the pace of 
technological advance vary for each fuel and each sector, depending on our assessment 
of the potential for efficiency improvements and the stage of technology development 
and commercialisation. Crucially, no altogether new technologies on the demand or 
supply side, beyond those known about today, are assumed to be deployed before 
the end of the projection period, since it cannot be known whether or when such 
breakthroughs might occur and how quickly they may be commercialised. 
The average energy efficiency of equipment currently in use and the overall intensity of 
energy consumption are typically assumed to improve progressively over the projection 
period. However, the rate of improvement varies considerably among different types 
of equipment, primarily according to the rate of retirement and replacement of the 
capital stock. Since much of the energy-using capital stock in use today will be replaced 
only gradually, most of the impact of recent and future technological developments 
that improve energy efficiency will not be felt until near the end of the projection 
12.  In mid-2008, prices approached $200 per tonne for certain qualities of coal in some European markets 
and $150 in the United States.

74 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
period. Rates of capital-stock turnover differ greatly (Figure 1.6). Most of today’s cars 
and trucks, heating and cooling systems, and industrial boilers will be replaced by 
2030. But most existing buildings, roads, railways and airports, as well as many power 
stations and refineries, will still be in use then, barring strong government action to 
encourage or force early retirement (which is not assumed in the Reference Scenario). 
Despite slow capital stock turnover, refurbishment could, in some cases, significantly 
improve energy efficiency at acceptable economic cost.
On  the  supply  side,  technological  advances  are  assumed  to  improve  the  technical 
and economic efficiency of producing and supplying energy. In some cases, they are 
expected to reduce unit costs and to lead to new and cleaner ways of producing and 
delivering energy services. For example, power-generation thermal efficiencies – as 
measured by the amount of useful electricity and heat energy produced, divided by 
the amount of energy contained in the fuel input – are assumed to improve over the 
projection period, but at different rates for different technologies. Exploration and 
production techniques for oil and gas are also expected to improve, boosting exploration 
success rates, raising recovery rates and opening up new opportunities for developing 
hard-to-exploit resources. Upstream technology research and development spending by 
the oil and gas industry has been rising rapidly in recent years (see Part B).
Some major new supply-side technologies that are approaching the commercialisation 
phase are assumed to become available and to be deployed to some degree before the 
end of the projection period. These include:
Carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)   :  This  is  a  promising  option  for  mitigating 
emissions of CO 2  from power plants and other industrial facilities, though it has not 
yet been deployed on a significant scale (IEA, 2008). The basic technology already 
exists to capture the gas and to transport and store it permanently in geological 
formations.  There  are  at  present  four  large-scale  CCS  projects  in  operation 
around the world, each involving the separation of around 1 Mt of CO 2  per year 
from produced natural gas: Sleipner and Snohvit in Norway, Weyburn in Canada 
(with the CO 2  sourced in the United States) and In Salah in Algeria. The captured 
CO 2  is used for enhanced oil recovery in the latter two projects. Yet there are a 
number  of  technical,  economic  and  legal  barriers  to  the  more  widespread  and 
rapid deployment of CCS. In particular, it is very energy-intensive and expensive. 
Considerable research and development effort is currently going into CCS in power 
generation. Around 20 demonstration projects are already under construction or are 
planned, which are expected to lead to lower unit costs and improved operational 
performance. We assume that CCS will become commercially available after 2020 in 
countries where adequate financial incentives and/or regulatory measures to reduce 
CO 2  emissions are already in place. 
Second-generation  biofuels   :  New  biofuels  technologies  being  developed  today, 
notably hydrolysis and gasification of woody ligno-cellulosic feedstock to produce 
ethanol,  are  assumed  to  reach  commercialisation  by  around  2020.  Although  the 
technology already exists, more research is needed to improve process efficiencies, 
especially  enzymatic  hydrolysis  to  extract  fermentable  sugar  from  the  ligno-
cellulosic material contained in plant material and to produce a fermented broth 
with a higher concentration of ethanol. There is virtually no commercial production

of ethanol yet from cellulosic biomass, but there is substantial research going on in 
this area in several OECD countries. The US Energy Independence and Security Act 
mandated investment in advanced biofuels. Commercial-scale demonstration plants 
are under construction in the United States and several others are planned in Europe 
and other parts of the world.
Coal-to-liquids  (CTL)   :  The  indirect  conversion  of  coal  to  oil  products  through 
gasification  and  Fischer-Tropsch  synthesis  processes  –  much  like  gas-to-liquids 
production  –  has  been  carried  out  commercially  for  many  decades.  Yet  global 
production remains limited as CTL production has in most cases been uneconomic 
up  to  now,  mainly  because  of  the  large  amounts  of  energy  and  water  used  in 
the process, the high cost of building CTL plants and volatile oil and coal prices. 
Recently,  research  has  been  focused  on  direct  liquefaction,  which  is  much  less 
energy-intensive than the indirect CTL method, though the liquids produced require 
further  refining  to  meet  applicable  fuel  standards,  increasing  unit  costs.  The 
Chinese coal company Shenhua is commissioning in 2008 a 20 000-b/d demonstration 
plant at Erdos in Inner Mongolia and more plants are planned in China and the United 
States. The full commercialisation of direct liquefaction technologies is expected 
to develop over the Outlook period, boosting their deployment in countries with 
abundant  low-cost  coal  and  freshwater  resources  (see  Chapter  11  for  detailed 
projections of CTL production).

H I G H L I G H T S
GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS
World energy use continues to increase steadily in the Reference Scenario, but at   z
a slower rate than projected in WEO-2007, mainly due to higher energy prices and 
slower economic growth. Global primary energy demand grows by 1.6% per year 
on average in 2006-2030. Oil demand increases progressively, though more slowly 
than in WEO-2007, particularly in the second half of the Outlook period.
Fossil fuels account for 80% of the world’s primary energy mix in 2030 — down   z
slightly on today. Oil remains the dominant fuel, though demand for coal rises 
more than demand for any other fuel in absolute terms. The share of natural gas 
in total energy demand rises marginally, with most of the growth coming from the 
power-generation sector. Coal continues to account for about half of fuel needs 
for  power  generation.  The  contribution  of  non-hydro  renewables  to  meeting 
primary energy needs inches up from 11% now to 12% in 2030.
Due to strong economic growth, China and India account for 51% of incremental   z
world primary energy demand in 2006-2030. Middle East countries emerge as an 
important demand centre. Of the global increase in oil demand, 43% comes from 
China, 20% from the Middle East and 19% from India. Over a quarter of the growth 
in world gas demand comes from the Middle East. Non-OECD countries account 
for 87% of the increase in global demand between 2006 and 2030. As a result, 
their share of world primary energy demand rises from 51% to 62%.
Industry  overtakes  transport  before  2010  to  become  the  second-largest   z
final  energy-consuming  sector,  after  the  combined  residential,  services  and 
agricultural sector. Among all final energy forms, electricity consumption grows 
fastest,  nearly  doubling  in  2006-2030,  boosting  its  share  in  total  final  energy 
consumption from 17% to 21%. Oil remains the single largest end-use fuel, though 
its share drops from 43% in 2006 to 40% in 2030. 
Almost all of the increase in fossil-fuel production over the   z Outlook period occurs 
in non-OECD countries. The Middle East and Africa are the biggest contributors 
to increased exports. As a result, the reliance on imported oil and gas of the 
main  consuming  regions,  including  the  OECD  and  Asian  economies,  increases 
substantially, particularly in the second half of the projection period. 
Cumulative investment needs amount to $26.3 trillion (in year-2007 dollars) in   z
2007-2030, over $4 trillion more than posited in WEO-2007. The power sector 
accounts for $13.6 trillion, or 52% of the total. To provide adequate assurance 
for future investment in energy-supply infrastructure, negotiations need to be 
concluded on an international agreement on combating climate change and the 
implications for national policies quickly assessed.

Demand
Primary energy mix
Projected  world  primary  energy  demand  in  the  Reference  Scenario  increases  by  45% 
between 2006 and 2030 – an average annual rate of growth of 1.6% (Table 2.1). 1  This is 
0.2 percentage points slower than the rate projected in last year’s Outlook, largely due 
to changes in our assumptions for energy prices and economic growth, as well as new 
government policies introduced since last year (Box 2.1). It is also slower than the average 
growth of 1.9% per year from 1980 to 2006. World energy intensity — primary energy 
demand per unit of real GDP (in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms) — is expected to 
decline over the projection period by 1.7% a year, 0.6 percentage points faster than over 
the past three decades. Lower energy intensity is primarily the result of acceleration in 
the transition to a service economy in many major non-OECD countries and more rapid 
efficiency improvements in the power and end-use sectors in the OECD.

World demand for coal advances by 2% a year on average, its share in global energy 
demand climbing from 26% in 2006 to 29% in 2030. Most of the increase in demand for 
coal comes from the power-generation sector. China and India together contribute 
85% to the increase in world coal demand over the projection period. Oil remains the 
dominant fuel in the primary energy mix, but its share drops to 30% in 2030, from 
34% in 2006. Oil demand grows far more slowly than demand for other fossil fuels, 
mainly because of high final prices. Gas demand increases at 1.8% per annum over the 
projection period and its share in world primary energy moves up slightly, to 22% in 
2030. New power plants, using high-efficiency gas turbine technology for the most part, 
meet the bulk of incremental gas demand. The Middle East, developing Asian countries 
and the OECD see the biggest increases in gas demand. 
The share of nuclear power in primary energy demand edges down over the Outlook 
period, from 6% today to 5% in 2030, reflecting the assumption of unchanging national

policies  towards  nuclear  power.  Nuclear  output  nonetheless  increases  in  absolute 
terms in all major regions except OECD Europe. The largest increases will take place 
in developing Asia. There is considerable uncertainty about the prospects for nuclear 
power, given a recent revival of interest in re-evaluating the role of nuclear power in 
order to combat climate change. A change in policy could lead to a significantly higher 
share of nuclear power in the energy mix than assumed here (see Chapter 6).
Box 2.1 z  How do the new 
WEO
 assumptions affect global energy trends 
compared with last year?
Higher energy prices and slower economic growth than assumed last year are 
the main reasons why demand grows more slowly in this year’s Outlook. World 
GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.3% per year in 2006-2030, compared 
with 3.6% in WEO-2007. The IEA crude oil import price reaches $122 per barrel in 
real terms in 2030 in this year’s WEO, very nearly twice the level in WEO-2007. 
Lower economic growth reduces the overall demand for energy services. Higher 
prices encourage consumers and businesses to conserve energy and to buy more 
efficient  appliances  and  equipment.  They  also  encourage  manufacturers  to 
develop more energy-efficient equipment.
Assumptions  about  policy  and  technology  have  also  changed.  A  number  of 
countries, mostly in the OECD, have adopted during the past year new policies 
that substantially affect energy-demand prospects. These are taken into account 
in  the  Reference  Scenario.  One  example  is  the  US  Energy  Independence  and 
Security Act, which mandates vehicle fuel-economy improvements and higher 
production  of  biofuels  (see  Chapter  1).  This  year’s  WEO  also  assumes  that 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be introduced in the power-generation 
and industry sectors towards the end of the projection period, although only a 
few plants are assumed to be in operation in 2030 (nearly all of them in OECD 
countries and China). By 2030, coal plants with CCS consume about 0.2% of all 
the coal used worldwide. This year’s supply-side projections also reflect higher 
marginal costs and faster decline rate assumptions in the oil and gas sector in key 
producing countries. 
As a result of these changes, demand for each fossil fuel grows less rapidly than 
projected last year. Global demand for coal is 86 Mtoe lower in 2030 than in 
WEO-2007, while gas demand is 278 Mtoe lower. The biggest change, however, 
is in global oil demand. In 2030, world primary oil consumption is 5 109 Mtoe in 
this year’s Outlook, compared with 5 585 Mtoe last year. Higher oil prices and 
vehicle fuel-efficiency improvements are the main drivers of this change. Faster 
growth in the use of biofuels for transport, aided by the penetration of second-
generation  biofuel  technologies  towards  the  end  of  the  Outlook  period,  also 
contributes.  Excluding  hydropower  and  biomass  and  waste,  other  renewables 
grow  more  quickly  in  this  WEO,  by  284  Mtoe  in  2006-2030,  compared  with 
247 Mtoe in 2005-2030 in last year’s WEO.

Hydropower has long been a major source of electricity production and its relative 
importance does not change in the Reference Scenario. While most of the OECD’s low-
cost, hydro-electric resources have already been exploited, several large-scale projects 
in  non-OECD  countries  are  expected  to  be  launched  over  the  Outlook  period  (see 
Chapter 7). World hydropower production grows by an average 1.9% a year, its share 
of primary demand remaining constant at 2%. Hydropower’s share in global electricity 
generation, however, drops two percentage points to 14% in 2030.

The use of biomass and waste for energy increases by 1.4% per year. 2  This figure masks 
considerable differences among countries in how this energy source is used: the use of 
biomass in modern applications such as biofuels and power generation rises quickly, 
while the use of traditional biomass in inefficient cooking stoves in poor households in 
less developed parts of the world grows at a much slower pace. The use of biomass and 
waste for power generation, mainly in OECD countries, grows at 5.4% per year, albeit 
from a low base. Other renewables, a category that includes wind, solar, geothermal, 
tidal and wave energy, grow faster than any other energy source, at an average rate of 
7.2% per year over the projection period. Most of the increase is in the power sector. 
The share of other renewables in total power generation grows from 1% in 2006 to 4% 
in 2030. 
Regional trends
Energy demand in non-OECD countries exceeded that in OECD countries in 2005 for 
the first time ever (Figure 2.2). The faster pace of demand growth outside the OECD is 
set to continue. Driven mainly by brisk growth in China and India, non-OECD countries 
account for 87% of the increase in global demand between 2006 and 2030. As a result, 
the non-OECD share of world primary energy demand rises from 51% in 2006 to 62% by

2030. Steady economic growth and industrial expansion, population increase and higher 
urbanisation  rates  drive  demand  growth  in  non-OECD  countries.  The  replacement 
of fuelwood and charcoal with oil and gas also plays a major role. Growth in energy

The volumetric increase in China’s energy demand in 2006-2030 dwarfs that of all other 
countries and regions, the result of its rapid economic and population growth. The 
almost 2 000-Mtoe increase in demand in 2006-2030 is nearly four times bigger than 
the combined increase in all of the countries in Latin America and Africa, and more 
than three times as large as the increase in the OECD (Figure 2.3). China’s contribution 
to incremental global oil demand is 43%. India accounts for 19%. The countries of the 
Middle East, most of them key oil and/or gas producers, emerge as a major oil- and 
gas-consuming region. It sees the second-largest increase in global oil demand, after 
China. This increase in the Middle East is underpinned by rapid economic growth and 
by persistent subsidies on oil products. 3  In the case of coal, China accounts for 66% of 
the global increase in demand. By 2030, OECD countries account for less than a quarter 
of global coal use. In contrast, OECD countries account for 46% of the global increase 
in the use of renewables.

Changes in the fuel mix vary considerably across regions. In the OECD, where overall 
demand grows very slowly over the projection period, oil demand falls slightly, while 
gas  and  non-hydro  renewables  make  up  most  of  the  increase  in  energy  demand. 
Demand  in  Eastern  Europe  and  Eurasian  countries  (including  Russia)  grows  by  only 
336 Mtoe between 2006 and 2030, with nearly 60% of this increase taking the form 
of natural gas and oil. While China and India continue to rely predominately on coal, 
incremental energy demand in other Asian countries and in Latin America is remarkably 
diverse. Despite having the highest regional rate of increase in coal consumption, the 
Middle East countries rely almost entirely on oil and gas to meet additional energy 
needs over the projection period. Incremental gas demand in this region is equal to 26% 
of the world total. The Middle East becomes the third-largest gas consumer, after OECD 
North America and OECD Europe, surpassing projected demand in the entire European 
3.  See Chapter 1 for a detailed discussion of subsidies.

Union in 2030. Under the assumptions of the Reference Scenario, the only region where 
nuclear power expands significantly is Asia, with most of the increase occurring in 
China. Biomass and waste and other renewables account for nearly 40% of incremental 
energy demand in Africa, consumed mostly as fuelwood, crop residues and charcoal for 
cooking and heating. By contrast, the 61% contribution of biomass and other non-hydro 
renewables to incremental energy demand in OECD countries is in the form of modern 
technologies, mostly wind.  
In  2030,  disparities  in  per-capita  energy  consumption  among  regions  remain  stark 
(Figure 2.4). Middle East countries see a rapid increase in per-capita consumption, over-
taking OECD Europe by 2030. Despite the relatively small increase in energy demand 
over the Outlook period, Russia still has the highest per-capita energy consumption, 
at 7.0 toe, in 2030. Per-capita consumption increases rapidly from 1.4 toe in 2006 to 
2.7 toe in 2030 in China, thanks to a booming economy and slower population growth 
compared with African and other Asian countries. India’s per-capita energy use is only 
0.9 toe in 2030, but up from 0.5 toe in 2006. On average across countries, per-capita 
consumption in sub-Saharan Africa is only 0.5 toe in 2030 — about a third of the level 
in Latin America and one-ninth of that in OECD countries.

Sectoral trends
The combined power-generation and heat sector absorbs a growing share of global 
primary  energy  demand  over  the  projection  period.  Its  share  reaches  over  42% 
in  2030,  compared  with  38%  in  2006.  Coal  remains  the  leading  input  for  power-
generation and heat, its share of total inputs holding steady at about 47% over the 
Outlook period. Oil’s share falls from 6% in 2006 to 3% in 2030, while the share of gas 
83

rises from 21% to 23%. Nuclear power’s contribution falls from 16% in 2006 to 13% in 
2030. Hydropower’s share remains steady at 6%. Inputs from non-hydro renewables, 
mostly wind and biomass and waste, grow worldwide at an average rate of 6.2% per 
year between 2006 and 2030, the fastest rate of all energy sources, with their share 
rising to 8% in 2030.
Aggregate  demand  in  final-use  sectors  (industry,  transport,  residential,  services, 
agriculture and non-energy use) is projected to grow by 1.4% per year from 2006 to 
2030 — slightly more slowly than primary energy demand (Table 2.3). Industry demand 
grows most rapidly, at 1.8% per annum, overtaking transport before 2010 as the second-
largest final-use sector, after the combined residential, services and agriculture sector. 
Industry demand increases everywhere, but fastest in the Middle East and non-OECD 
Asia. The rate of growth in global transport energy demand slows considerably over 
the Outlook period. It averages 1.5% per year on average in 2006-2030 compared with 
2.3% in 1980-2006, largely as a result of improved fuel efficiency of the vehicle fleet 
(see Chapter 3). Residential, services and agriculture consumption grows at an average 
annual rate of 1.2%, slower than the rate of growth of 1.5% per year in 1980-2006, due 
to efficiency improvements and fuel switching.

Chapter 2 - Global energy trends
Among all end-use sources of energy except other renewables, electricity is projected 
to  grow  most  rapidly  worldwide,  by  2.5%  per  year  from  2006  to  2030. 4   Electricity 
consumption nearly doubles over that period, pushing up its share in total final energy 
consumption  from  17%  to  21%.  Electricity  use  expands  most  rapidly  in  non-OECD 
countries, by 3.8% per year; it increases by 1.1% per year in the OECD. 
The share of coal in world final consumption remains broadly constant at about 9%. 
Coal use expands in industry, but only in non-OECD countries. The share of gas in 
world final consumption does not change. Final gas demand rises by 1.3% per year on 
average, with most of the increase in non-OECD countries. Oil demand grows by 1.2% 
per year, with almost three-quarters of the increase coming from transport. Biofuels 
for  transport,  nearly  all  of  which  are  produced  from  first-generation  technologies, 
account for 4% of total transport energy demand in 2030, a significant increase over 
the 1% share in 2006. 
The use of biomass and waste rises in absolute terms in the residential, services and 
agriculture sector, but its share of total final energy use in these sectors combined 
drops from 28% in 2006 to 22% in 2030. The share of electricity in this sector rises 
to 34% in 2030 from 26% in 2006. Despite rapid growth in some countries, per-capita 
electricity  consumption,  particularly  in  Africa,  remains  far  below  that  of  OECD 
countries  in  2030  (see  Chapter  6).  Per-capita  annual  electricity  demand  in  the 
residential sector in OECD countries averages 2 835 kWh in 2030, compared with 
565 kWh in non-OECD countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is only 132 kWh per capita 
in 2030. 5  Other renewables, mostly photovoltaic, achieve some penetration in the 
combined residential, services and agriculture sectors, but still meet only about 2% 
of this sector’s global energy needs in 2030. 
Energy production and trade
Resources and production prospects
We judge that the world’s overall energy resources are adequate to meet the projected 
growth  in  energy  demand  to  2030.  The  key  to  tapping  the  available  resources  is 
mobilising  investment  in  a  timely  manner.  Restrictions  on  oil  and  gas  investment 
in many of the most prospective areas mean that investment does not always go to 
developing the cheapest reserves. Increasingly, fossil-energy supplies will have to come 
from deposits that are more difficult and costly to exploit, including deepwater and 
non-conventional oil and gas resources. Yet technologies for extracting such resources 
are constantly improving. We expect non-conventional and frontier resources to carve 
out a growing share of global oil and gas supplies by 2030 (see Part B). The related costs 
4.  Other renewables, mostly solar heating and cooling, grow from a very low base and account for only 1% 
of global ﬁ nal energy demand in 2030.
5.  See  Chapter  15  for  a  discussion  of  electricity  access  in  oil-  and  gas-rich  countries  of  sub-Saharan 
Africa.

will undoubtedly be higher than in the past, with the technical challenge enhanced by 
higher raw material and equipment costs across the board. This is one reason why we 
are assuming higher prices in this year’s Outlook. 
Proven and probable reserves of natural gas are much larger than for oil. However, as 
for oil, some factors — such as geopolitical and technical risks, investment restrictions 
and national policy constraints in resource-rich countries — cast doubt over the extent 
to which the long-term potential can be converted to actual supply capacity. Concerns 
about the potential to expand coal supplies are less pronounced, though the associated 
costs are uncertain.  There is a large quantity of uranium resources that could be mined 
for nuclear power production. Although location-specific, renewable energy sources 
are also abundant. 
Most of the increase in oil production over the projection period is expected to come 
from a small number of countries where remaining resources are concentrated. These 
include several OPEC countries, mainly in the Middle East, and a handful of non-OPEC 
countries, notably Canada (with vast oil-sands reserves), the Caspian countries and 
Brazil. The majority of oil-producing countries will see their output drop. The OPEC 
share in total production in the Reference Scenario rises from 44% today to 51% in 2030, 
on the assumption that the requisite investment is forthcoming, which over the past 
decade has not always been the case. Natural gas liquids and non-conventional sources 
— mainly Canadian oil sands — make a growing contribution to world oil supplies over 
the Outlook period. 
Production of natural gas resources, which are more widely dispersed than oil, increases 
in all regions except OECD Europe (see Chapter 4). The biggest increases are projected 
to occur in the Middle East and Africa, where large, low-cost reserves are found. Gas 
production triples in the Middle East and more than doubles in Africa. Supply costs 
have been rising quickly as a result of both the cost inflation that has afflicted all parts 
of the energy sector and the increased length of supply chains as consuming regions 
become more reliant on more distant sources. 
Although  there  are  abundant  coal  reserves  in  most  regions,  increases  in  coal 
production  are  likely  to  be  concentrated  where  extraction,  processing  and 
transportation costs are lowest. China is set to reinforce its position as the world’s 
leading coal producer, accounting for close to two-thirds of the increase in global 
output  over  the  projection  period  in  the  Reference  Scenario  (though  this  is  not 
sufficient to meet domestic demand growth). The United States, India and Australia 
remain the next biggest producers. Most of the increase in world coal production 
takes the form of steam coal.
The shift in the geographical sources of incremental energy supplies over the Outlook 
period is pronounced. Gas production in the OECD as a whole declines by 31 bcm, 
due to a 88-bcm decline in production in OECD Europe. Oil production increases in 
the OECD, but only by 1.4 mb/d (Figure 2.5). The increase in oil production in non-
OECD countries in 2007-2030 is 20 mb/d. Most of the incremental coal production 
comes from non-OECD countries; OECD countries contribute about 10% to the global 
increase.

Inter-regional trade
International trade in energy is expected to expand, in both absolute terms and 
as  a  share  of  production,  to  accommodate  the  mismatch  between  the  location 
of demand and that of production. The share of oil traded between WEO regions 
is  projected  to  grow  by  35%  between  2007  and  2030,  as  production  becomes 
increasingly concentrated in a small number of resource-rich countries. The decline 
in gas production in OECD countries leads to more imports in the form of liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) and, to a lesser extent, by pipeline. Coal trade also increases. 
Even China, the world’s largest coal producer, sees its coal imports rise to meet its 
galloping demand (see Chapter 5). Inter-regional trade in other fuels and carriers 
remains small. 
Growing  fossil-energy  trade  has  major  implications  for  energy  security,  a  point 
highlighted in last year’s Outlook (IEA, 2007). Of the net oil-importing regions today — 
the three OECD regions and non-OECD Asia — OECD Europe and Asia become even more 
dependent on imports over the projection period (see Chapter 3). While still remaining 
significant oil importers, the OECD North America and Pacific regions see their net 
imports decline. The Middle East, already the biggest exporting region, sees its share 
of inter-regional oil trade rise from 49% in 2007 to 52% in 2030. Such a development 
intensifies  concerns  about  the  world’s  vulnerability  to  a  price  shock  induced  by  a 
supply  disruption.  Maintaining  the  security  of  international  sea  lanes  and  pipelines 
will become more important as oil and gas supply chains lengthen (see Figure 3.11 in 
Chapter 3 and Figure 4.6 in Chapter 4).

88 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Energy investment
Trends by region and energy source
The Reference Scenario projections call for cumulative investment in energy-supply 
infrastructure  of  $26.3  trillion  (in  year-2007  dollars)  over  2007-2030  (Table  2.4). 
This amount is around $4.4 trillion higher than in WEO-2007, because of an upward 
revision in assumed unit costs. More than half of global investment, or $13.6 trillion, 
goes towards the power sector. Oil- and gas-sector investments total $11.7 trillion, 
$2.2 trillion  higher  than  last  year’s  Outlook,  with  over  65%  required  in  non-OECD 
countries. Coal-industry investments (not including transportation) are much smaller, 
totalling less than $730 billion, or 3% of total energy investment. The production of coal 
is inherently much less capital intensive than that of oil, gas or electricity.
Unit capital costs, especially in the oil and gas industry, have surged in the last year, 
leading  to  an  upward  revision  in  our  assumed  costs  for  the  projection  period  (see 
Chapter 13). Huge inflows of capital are needed to expand supply capacity to meet 
rising  demand,  as  well  as  to  replace  existing  and  future  supply  facilities  that  will 
be  retired  during  the  projection  period.  Just  over  half  of  projected  global  energy 
investment goes simply to maintain the current level of supply capacity: much of the 
world’s current production capacity for oil, gas, coal and electricity will need to be 
replaced by 2030. In addition, some of the new production capacity brought on stream 
in  the  early  years  of  the  projection  period  will  need  to  be  replaced  before  2030. 
Many power plants, electricity and gas transmission and distribution facilities, and oil 
refineries will also need to be replaced or refurbished.

The Reference Scenario projections of electricity supply call for cumulative investment 
of $13.6 trillion, 58% of which is needed in non-OECD countries. Power generation 
accounts for half of this amount (Figure 2.6). Global needs in this sector are over 
$2 trillion more than projected in WEO-2007. Much of the increase is due to rising raw 
material and equipment costs (see Chapter 6). Financing the building of new energy 
infrastructure will be a major challenge, especially for poorer countries that rely on 
public sources of finance. 
Due  to  the  world’s  rising  reliance  on  oil  and  gas  from  the  Middle  East,  Africa  and 
other non-OECD countries, the rapid development of power infrastructure in many of 
these countries and fast-rising energy needs in China and India, most of the required 
investment is needed in non-OECD countries. Mobilising this investment will require 
the lowering of regulatory and market barriers. Many major oil and gas producers in 
Africa, the Middle East and Latin America recognise the need for — and value of — 
foreign involvement. Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria and several countries in the Middle 
East have attracted joint-venture investment by international oil companies, although 
the  dominance  of  national  oil  companies  is  growing  in  many  other  countries  (see 
Chapter 14). Key coal producers also need to attract capital to meet their medium-
term production targets. Foreign investment could bring better management and a 
greater willingness to use the best available technologies, as well as access to capital, 
to many emerging economies. Many countries are liberalising and restructuring their 
electricity industries in order to attract private domestic and foreign investment, and 
to improve the way energy companies are run.

CHAPTER 3
Chapter 3 - Oil market outlook
H I G H L I G H T S
OIL MARKET OUTLOOK
Global primary demand for oil (excluding biofuels) in the Reference Scenario rises   z
by 1% per year on average, from 85 million barrels per day in 2007 to 106 mb/d in 
2030. This is a significant downward revision from last year’s Outlook, reflecting 
mainly  the  impact  of  much  higher  prices  and  slightly  slower  GDP  growth. 
New government policies introduced in the past year also contribute to lower 
demand.
All the increase in world oil demand comes from non-OECD countries. India sees   z
the fastest growth, averaging 3.9% per year over the Outlook period, followed by 
China, at 3.5%. High as they are, these growth rates are still significantly lower 
than historic trends. Other emerging Asian economies and the Middle East also 
see rapid growth. By contrast, demand in all three OECD regions falls, due largely 
to declining non-transport demand. As a result of these trends, the share of OECD 
countries in global oil demand drops from 57% in 2007 to 43% in 2030.
These oil-demand projections, combined with our oil-price assumptions, point to   z
persistently high levels of spending on oil in both OECD and non-OECD countries. 
As a share of world GDP at market exchange rates, oil spending soared from 
a  little  over  1%  in  1999  to  around  4%  in  2007,  with  serious  implications  for 
the economies of consuming countries. That share is projected to stabilise at 
around 5% over much of the Outlook period. For non-OECD countries, the share 
averages 6% to 7%.
Most of the projected increase in world oil supply comes from OPEC countries,   z
which hold the majority of the world’s remaining reserves of conventional oil. 
Their share of global output rises from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2030. Their reserves 
are  big  enough  for  output  to  grow  faster,  but  investment  is  assumed  to  be 
constrained, notably by conservative depletion policies and geopolitical factors.
Although global oil production is not expected to peak before 2030, output of   z
conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids levels off towards the end of the 
projection  period.  Non-conventional  oil  production,  mainly  from  oil  sands  in 
Canada, continues to grow steadily, keeping total non-OPEC output broadly flat 
over the second half of the projection period.
The  projected  increase  in  global  oil  output  hinges  on  adequate  and  timely   z
investment. There remains a real risk of a supply crunch in the medium term 
as the gap between the capacity that is due to come on stream from current

Demand
Trends in primary oil demand
Global primary oil demand 1  is projected to grow by 1.0% per year on average in the 
Reference Scenario, from 85 million barrels per day in 2007 to 94 mb/d in 2015 and to 
106 mb/d in 2030 (Table 3.1). The share of oil in global primary energy demand drops 
from 34% in 2006 to 30% in 2030. This is a significant, 10-mb/d downward revision from 
last year’s Outlook, reflecting the impact of much higher prices and slightly slower GDP 
growth. A number of new government policies introduced in the past year — notably 
moves in the United States and Europe to promote more fuel-efficient vehicles and 
encourage biofuels supply — also contribute to the reduction. The pace of demand 
growth slackens progressively over the projection period, from an average of 1.3% per 
year in 2007-2015 to 0.8% per year in 2015-2030.
Economic activity remains the principal driver of oil demand in all regions. Since 1980, 
each 1% per year increase in gross domestic product has been accompanied by a 0.3% 
rise in primary oil demand (Figure 3.1). This ratio — the oil intensity of GDP, or the 
amount of oil needed to produce one dollar of GDP — has fallen steadily over the last 
three decades. However, the decline has accelerated since 2004, mainly as a result 
of higher oil prices, which have encouraged conservation, more efficient oil use and 
switching to other fuels. In 2007, global oil intensity (expressed in purchasing power 
parities, or PPP) was barely half the level of the early 1970s.
1.  Preliminary data on total oil demand by region only are available for 2007. The breakdown of oil demand 
by sector is available to 2006. Oil does not include biofuels derived from biomass, though transport demand 
for oil is modelled in a way that takes account of the use of biofuels. Regional totals do not include interna-
tional marine bunkers. For these reasons, the oil projections in this report are not directly comparable with 
those published in the IEA’s Oil Market Report. See Annex B for a detailed deﬁ nition of oil. 
92 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
projects and that needed to keep pace with demand widens sharply after 2010, 
squeezing  spare  capacity  and  driving  up  oil  prices  –  possibly  to  new  record 
highs.
The volume of inter-regional oil trade increases by a third between 2007 and   z
2030. The Middle East, already the biggest exporting region, sees its net exports 
rise most. OECD Europe and Asia become even more dependent on imports over 
the projection period, but net imports drop in North America and in OECD Pacific. 
Though increased trade consolidates mutual dependence, it also enhances the 
risk of short-term supply interruptions, particularly as much of the additional oil 
imports will have to come from the Middle East and transit vulnerable maritime 
routes.

The  downward  trend  in  global  oil  intensity  is  projected  to  continue  through  the 
projection period: by 2.2% per year on average between 2007 and 2030 compared with 
2.1% in 1980-2007. At present, non-OECD countries are more oil-intensive than the 
OECD as a whole (using GDP on a PPP basis). By around 2015, their intensities more or 
less converge and then continue to decline at similar rates through to 2030 (Figure 3.2). 
The faster rate of decline in oil intensity in non-OECD countries in the first half of the 
projection period results from a relatively higher percentage increase in prices to end 
users there as subsidies are reduced on prices which carry a smaller burden of taxation 
(which, in OECD countries, cushions the impact on demand of changes in international 
prices). Each percentage-point increase in world GDP yields an increase in oil demand 
of 0.31% in 2015 and 0.24% in 2030.

The apparent lack of responsiveness of global oil demand so far to the very substantial 
rise in international oil prices since the end of the 1990s and especially since 2004 
contrasts sharply with the fall in demand that followed the two oil shocks of the 1970s 
(Figure 3.3). Five main factors explain this difference:
The recent price surge has been driven in part by very strong economic growth   
worldwide, which has pushed up demand. In contrast, the oil shocks of the 1970s 
were largely supply-driven and, given the higher oil intensity of the world economy 
at the time, quickly depressed economic activity. 
Opportunities for end users to switch from oil to other fuels are more limited than in   
the past, largely because of the bigger share of oil use that now goes to transport. 
Viable alternatives to gasoline and diesel remain limited for now. 
Price  subsidies  in  many  non-OECD  countries,  which  prevent  higher  international   
crude oil and product prices from feeding through fully into final prices, thereby 
cushioning the impact on demand, have risen sharply (Box 3.1). The majority of oil 
consumers worldwide do not pay prices that fully reflect international market levels. 
By contrast, high excise-tax rates in most OECD countries mean that increases in 
international prices lead to much smaller proportionate increases in final prices.

Chapter 3 - Oil market outlook
The depreciation of the dollar against most major currencies has offset part of the   
increase in spot prices in recent years. Expressed in euros, for example, prices since 
the beginning of 2000 to the middle of 2008 rose only 57% as much as in dollars 
(Figure 3.4).
The increase in prices was very sudden in the first two oil shocks, whereas prices   
have risen in a much steadier manner since 2004.

Box 3.1  z  The impact on demand of removing oil subsidies
With oil-product prices subject to government price controls in the majority of 
non-OECD countries, the run-up in international prices in recent years has led to 
much higher subsidies in most of them because retail prices have been adjusted 
only with a lag and not to the full extent of the international price change. In 
many countries, these subsidies — which are typically either covered directly out 
of  government  budgets  or  are  absorbed  by  national  companies  —  are  reaching 
unsustainable  levels.  For  example,  if  prices  had  remained  at  mid-year  levels 
Venezuela’s subsidy to oil products would have risen to around $14 billion in 2008, 
and the subsidy in Mexico, the only OECD country that still controls oil prices, to 
$20 billion — equal to several percentage points of GDP.
Several  countries  are  starting  to  address  this  problem.  In  early  2008,  Chinese 
Taipei and Sri Lanka raised gasoline and diesel prices. In May, Indonesia raised the 
prices of kerosene, diesel and gasoline by between a quarter and a third, though 
these fuels remain heavily subsidised. In June, China announced a rise of around 
18% in the pump prices of gasoline and diesel, while India raised pump prices and 
the retail prices of bottled liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by between 8% and 17%. 
Malaysia raised gasoline prices by around 40% and diesel prices by two-thirds. Some 
other Asian countries, including Bangladesh and Vietnam, are expected to follow 
suit. Public resistance generally remains a major constraint on effective political 
action  to  reduce  and  remove  subsidies  in  non-OECD  countries.  Indeed,  some 
countries with subsidies were considering lowering controlled prices in response to 
the drop in international oil prices in August and early September 2008.
Recent  evidence  and  our  estimates  of  the  price  elasticities  of  demand  for  oil 
products  imply  that  moves  to  cut  subsidies  would  have  a  significant  effect  on 
overall oil demand, especially in the long term. The demand response would vary 
markedly by country, according to the extent of the subsidy and the oil products 
concerned. A 90% jump in the pump prices of gasoline and diesel in Indonesia in 
October 2005, for example, caused consumption to drop by 13% in 2006. The recent 
cut in Malaysian subsidies is expected to lead to a drop in road-fuel use of around 
5% in the next year or so. These moves will help to alleviate the upward pressure on 
international oil prices and domestic spending on transport in the coming years, as 
higher prices influence decisions to purchase cars and oil-consuming equipment.
There are, nonetheless, signs that high oil prices are beginning to affect oil demand, 
directly  and  indirectly,  through  their  depressive  impact  on  economic  activity.  The 
slowdown in demand has been most apparent in OECD countries, where prices have 
generally risen the most. Preliminary data point to a more than 1% drop in OECD inland 
deliveries (oil products supplied by refineries, pipelines and terminals) in June 2008 
compared with June 2007. Consumption of transport fuels has fallen sharply in some 
countries, including the United States, as people drive less and begin to switch to 
smaller cars. For example, new car sales in the United Kingdom in August 2008 fell to 
their lowest level in 42 years. Sales of large sports utility vehicles have fallen in most

Chapter 3 - Oil market outlook
countries, especially in the United States. Non-OECD oil demand, in contrast, continues 
to grow steadily, largely because incomes have continued to grow and prices in most 
countries have not risen so fast thanks to subsidies. 
As  a  result  of  these  factors,  oil  demand,  in  the  short  term  at  least,  is  relatively 
insensitive to movements in international crude oil prices. The weighted average crude 
oil price elasticity of total oil demand across all regions is estimated at -0.03 in the 
short term (in the first year following the price change) and -0.15 in the long term, 
based on econometric analysis of historical demand trends (IEA, 2006). 2  Using these 
estimates,  we  calculate  that,  had  international  prices  not  risen  since  2003,  global 
primary oil demand would have grown on average by 1.9% per year in the four years 
to 2007 — a mere 0.1 percentage points more than it actually did — on the assumption 
that nothing else was different. On this basis, world demand would, therefore, have 
been about 300 kb/d higher in 2007.
Regional trends
All  the  increase  in  world  oil  demand  between  2007  and  2030  comes  from  non-
OECD  countries  in  the  Reference  Scenario.  Their  demand  rises  by  22.8  mb/d, 
offsetting  a  2.5  mb/d  fall  in  the  OECD  (international  bunker  demand  rises  by 
almost  1  mb/d).  India  sees  the  fastest  rate  of  growth,  averaging  3.9%  per  year 
over  the  Outlook  period,  followed  by  China,  at  3.5%.  High  as  they  are,  these 
growth rates are still significantly lower than historic trends. India’s oil use grew 
by  5.6%  per  year  between  1980  and  2007  (quadrupling),  while  Chinese  oil  use 
increased almost as fast (from a larger base). In volumetric terms, China remains 
the  single  biggest  contributor  to  the  growth  in  world  oil  demand,  accounting  for 
43% of the total projected increase in 2007-2030 (Figure 3.5). Other emerging Asian

2.  The price elasticity of demand for oil products based on ﬁ nal prices is signiﬁ cantly higher and more ho-
mogeneous, as the impact of differences in tax and subsidy policies is stripped out. The ﬁ nal price elasticity 
of road-transport fuels, for example, is estimated at -0.15 in the short run (after one year) and -0.44 in the 
long run (IEA, 2006).

economies  and  the  Middle  East  also  see  rapid  rates  of  growth.  The  latter  region 
has emerged as a major oil consuming as well as producing region, on the back of a 
booming economy (helped by high oil prices) and heavily subsidised prices. Middle 
East  countries  account  for  20%  of  the  growth  in  oil  demand  over  the  projection 
period. Demand in all three OECD regions, by contrast, falls, most heavily in volume 
terms in the Pacific region and Europe. As a result of these trends, the non-OECD 
countries’ share of global oil demand (excluding international marine bunkers) rises 
from 43% in 2007 to 57% in 2030.
The  differences  in  per-capita  oil  consumption  across  regions  remain  striking.  The 
population of the Middle East reaches only 281 million in 2030, compared with nearly 
1.5 billion in China. Yet China’s oil use is only half as high as the Middle East’s. Per-
capita oil consumption reaches 13.6 barrels in the Middle East in 2030, compared with 
only 4.2 barrels in China and 12.3 barrels in the OECD. 
Sectoral trends
Around three-quarters of the projected increase in oil demand worldwide comes from the 
transport sector, the sector least responsive, in the short term, to price changes (Figure 3.6). 
In the OECD, oil use falls in all sectors except transport (where it is essentially flat).

with  52%  now  and  38%  in  1980  (Table  3.2).  Oil-based  fuels  continue  to  dominate 
transport energy demand, though their overall share falls slightly, from 94% in 2006 to 
92% in 2030, due to growing use of biofuels (see Chapter 7).

Despite continuing improvements in average vehicle fuel efficiency, spurred in part 
by high oil prices, 3  the sheer growth of the vehicle fleet — especially in non-OECD 
countries — is expected to continue to push up total oil use for transport purposes. 
There is not expected to be any major shift away from conventionally fuelled vehicles 
before 2030, though the penetration of hybrid-electric cars, including plug-ins (see the 
Spotlight below), is expected to rise, contributing to an overall improvement in fuel 
economy. Globally, passenger-car ownership is assumed to grow at 3.6% through the 
projection period, outpacing GDP slightly. The total light-duty vehicle stock rises from 
an estimated 650 million in 2005 to about 1.4 billion by 2030. The biggest increase in 
absolute terms is expected to occur in China, which accounts for almost one-third of
3.  There are signs that consumers are beginning to switch to smaller, more fuel-efﬁ cient cars in response to 
higher oil prices, especially in countries with lower tax rates and where prices have risen most in percentage 
terms. In the United States, for example, which has the lowest rates of tax on gasoline in the OECD, sales of 
sports utility vehicles have fallen heavily in the last two to three years.

the global increase in cars (Figure 3.7). Most of the rest of the increase comes from 
other non-OECD countries. The average size and power of new cars in these countries 
is expected to be significantly lower than in the OECD at present, which accounts for 
part of the global improvement in fuel economy.

Power  generation  currently  accounts  for  around  7%  of  global  primary 
oil consumption, down from 14% in 1980. Its share is projected to decline further, 
to  around  4%  in  2030.  The  volume  burned  in  power  stations  also  drops,  from 
277 Mtoe to about 204 Mtoe. By the end of the projection period, close to 85% 
of oil use for power is in non-OECD regions — about 40% of which is in the Middle 
East. Investment in refinery upgrading units is expected to continue to reduce the 
proportion of residual heavy fuel oil — which makes up the bulk of the oil used 
by power stations and by ships — in the output of refined products. The fuel oil 
that is produced is increasingly concentrated in the power sector. While the share 
of oil in overall fuel inputs to power generation is projected to fall sharply over 
the projection period, there may be pronounced short-term swings in response 
to fluctuations in relative oil, gas and coal prices, delays in bringing generating 
capacity  on  line,  and  unplanned  outages  of  other  base-load  plants.  A shortfall 
in  coal-fired  capacity  in  China  in  2004  led  to  a  surge  in  oil  burning,  which 
contributed significantly to a jump in world oil demand and to upward pressures 
on international prices.
Implications for spending on oil
These oil-demand projections, combined with our oil-price assumptions (described 
in Chapter 1), point to persistently high levels of spending on oil in both OECD and 
non-OECD countries. As a share of world GDP at market exchange rates, oil spending

Chapter 3 - Oil market outlook
What is the scope for switching from oil-fuelled to electric vehicles?
Electric vehicles continue to struggle to compete with conventional oil-fuelled 
cars and trucks. Although fuel costs for owners of electric vehicles are lower, 
the savings are not big enough to offset the much higher prices of the vehicles 
themselves.  Fuel  subsidies  in  many  non-OECD  countries  also  undermine  the 
attractiveness of electric vehicles.
Yet  electric-vehicle  technology  is  advancing  rapidly.  Vehicle  hybridisation, 
involving  the  addition  of  an  electric  motor  and  an  energy-storage  system 
(typically  a  battery)  to  a  conventional  engine/fuel  system,  has  attracted 
most investment and has already proved commercially successful — in spite of 
relatively high costs. Further improvements to storage systems are necessary to 
boost efficiency and lower costs: despite significant progress in recent years, 
even  the  best  lithium-ion  batteries  available  today  suffer  from  inadequate 
performance and high costs. Ultra-capacitors, which store energy in charged 
electrodes  rather  than  in  an  electrolyte,  are  increasingly  being  seen  as  a 
complement to batteries; they store less energy per unit weight than batteries 
but are able to deliver energy more quickly. Research into these technologies is 
expected to yield further major improvements in the coming years. 
In the longer term, plug-in hybrids, fully electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells 
appear to offer the greatest potential for reducing or eliminating the need for oil-
based fuels. Plug-in hybrids, in which the electric battery is recharged off the grid 
as well as through the vehicle’s internal recharging system, combine the efficiency 
advantages of using an electric motor for short distances with the convenience 
and longer range of an internal combustion engine. How quickly plug-ins become 
commercially viable will hinge on substantial improvements in the performance 
of electric batteries. The prospects for fully electric vehicles are less certain, as 
battery capacity needs to be even greater than for hybrids. The need for quick 
recharging and related infrastructure is an additional barrier. A lot of research 
effort  continues  to  be  focused  on  fuel  cells  powered  with  hydrogen  (stored 
on-board or supplied from a reformer using a hydrogen-rich feedstock). But, as 
with electric vehicles, a number of technical hurdles remain to be overcome in 
order to lower costs and make fuel-cell vehicles commercially viable.     
Neither  fully  electric  nor  hydrogen-powered  fuel-cell  vehicles  are  expected 
to become widely available before 2030 unless research efforts are stepped 
up and technological breakthroughs are achieved (limited penetration of the 
former is assumed only in the 450 Policy Scenario). They could, however, be 
commercialised widely before 2050. In the IEA’s most recent Energy Technology 
Perspectives, fuel-cell vehicles account for 33% to 50% of total car sales in the 
OECD and half those in the rest of the world by 2050 in scenarios that assume 
a  significant  increase  in  research  spending  over  the  next  decade  and  rapid 
reductions in unit costs.

soared from a little over 1% in 1998 to around 4% in 2007. On current trends, that 
share is set to approach 6% in 2008, stabilising at around 5% over much of the Outlook 
period (Figure 3.8). For non-OECD countries, the share is even higher, reaching 8% in 
2008 and falling back to above 6% by 2030. Only in the early 1980s has this share been 
so high in both OECD and non-OECD regions.

Production 4
World oil supply is projected to rise from 84 mb/d in 2007 to 106 mb/d in 2030. Netting 
out processing gains in refining, production reaches 104 mb/d (Table 3.3). The bulk of 
the projected increase in world oil supply is projected to come from OPEC countries, 
where most of the world’s remaining proven reserves of conventional crude oil are to 
be found. Their share of global output rises from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2030 — though 
this is still below the historical peak of 53% in 1973. Their reserves are, in principle, 
big enough and development costs low enough for output to grow faster than this. 
However,  investment  is  assumed  to  be  constrained  by  several  factors,  including 
conservative depletion policies and geopolitics (see Chapter 13).
Non-OPEC conventional oil production is projected to peak by around the middle of the 
next decade and then to decline slowly through to the end of the projection period. This 
is largely offset by rising non-conventional output, which keeps total non-OPEC output 
broadly flat over the second half of the projection period. Higher prices have stimulated 
new upstream investment in the last few years, though much of the rise in this upstream 
expenditure is due to higher costs (see Chapter 13). This investment will boost capacity

in the near term, more than offsetting natural production declines at existing fields 
(see Chapter 10). But dwindling new discoveries and a fall in the size of new fields are 
expected to drive up marginal development costs. As a result, oil prices are assumed to 
rise to stimulate the necessary investment. Production has already peaked in most non-
OPEC countries and will peak in most others before 2030. Russian output is projected 
to edge up by 2015 but then to drift lower towards the end of the Outlook period.

Although global oil production is not expected to peak before 2030, conventional crude

extra-heavy  oil,  gas-to-liquids  and  coal-to-liquids  (Figure  3.9).  These  increases  in 
global oil output hinge on adequate and timely investment, which remains a critical 
uncertainty (see Chapter 13). There remains a real risk of an oil-supply crunch in the 
medium term resulting from under-investment (Box 3.2).

Box 3.2 z  Averting a post-2010 oil-supply crunch
Despite shortages of equipment and labour, and lengthening delays in bringing 
new projects to completion, the current wave of upstream investment looks set 
to provide significant boost to oil-production capacity in the next two to three 
years. Based on our analysis of upstream investment, we expect gross capacity 
additions worldwide to cover demand growth and output declines from existing 
fields to 2010, pushing up spare capacity modestly (see Chapter 13 for details). 
However, capacity additions from current projects tail off after 2010. This largely 
reflects the upstream development cycle: many new projects will undoubtedly 
be sanctioned in the next two or three years as oil companies complete existing 
projects and move on to new ones. But the gap between what is currently being 
built and what will be needed to keep pace with demand is nonetheless set to 
widen sharply after 2010 (see Chapter 11). Around 7 mb/d of additional capacity 
needs to be brought on stream by 2015 (over and above the capacity that is already 
in the pipeline from current projects), most of which will need to be sanctioned 
within the next two years or so. 
The sheer scale of the investment needed raises questions about whether all of the 
additional capacity we project will be needed will actually occur. If actual capacity 
additions fall short of this amount, spare production capacity would be squeezed 
and oil prices would undoubtedly rise — possibly to new record highs (Jesse and van 
der Linde, 2008; Stevens, 2008). These concerns are behind the initiative of the UK 
prime minister to invite major oil producing and consuming countries to a meeting 
in London in December 2008 to discuss ways of lowering barriers to investment, 
following up a meeting in Jeddah (in which the IEA participated) called by Saudi 
Arabia in June. Boosting investment in the resource-rich countries, which, in many 
cases, is restricted, will be of critical importance to averting a supply crunch.

Chapter 3 - Oil market outlook
Inter-regional trade
The mismatch between demand growth and the sources of incremental production 
means that inter-regional trade in oil (crude oil, NGLs and refined products) increases 
sharply during the projection period in the Reference Scenario. The volume of trade 
reaches 55 mb/d in 2030 — over half of global oil production and over 35% more than 
at present (Table 3.4). Net exports from the Middle East, already the biggest exporting 
region, rise from 19.9 mb/d in 2007 to 28.5 mb/d in 2030, representing 52% of global 
trade in 2030, up from 49% today. Net exports from Africa and Eastern Europe/Eurasia 
(thanks to the Caspian region) also continue to expand steadily. Brazil contributes 
most to the increase in net exports from Latin America in the early part of the Outlook 
period, and Venezuela thereafter.
Of the net oil-importing regions today — the three OECD regions and non-OECD Asia — 
Europe and Asia become even more dependent on imports over the projection period 
(Figure  3.10).  By  contrast,  net  imports  into  North  America  drop  from  10.7  mb/d 
to  5.9  mb/d,  largely  thanks  to  rising  Canadian  oil  sands  production  and  a  sharp 
slowdown in demand. Net imports into the United States alone drop much less, from 
13.2 mb/d in 2007 to 11.9 mb/d in 2030 — equal to 63% of total consumption. Import 
dependency in the OECD Pacific region also falls slightly, to 90% in 2030 compared 
with  92%  currently.  OECD  Europe,  by  contrast,  sees  a  sharp  rise  in  net  import 
dependence, from 65% to 84%, as a result of the projected rapid decline in North 
Sea production. Net imports into the OECD as a whole decline as a share of total 
oil demand from 58% in 2007 to 52% in 2030. In Asia, the increase in dependence is 
dramatic in India, where imports meet almost all the country’s needs in 2030, and 
in China, which became a net oil importer only in 1993. China’s imports rise from 
3.8 mb/d in 2007 to 12.5 mb/d in 2030, equal to 75% of China’s total oil demand, 
compared with 50% in 2007.

106 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Increased  trade  consolidates  global  interdependence,  but  the  risk  to  consuming 
countries of short-term supply interruptions grows as geographic supply diversity is 
actually reduced, increasing reliance on a few supply routes. Much of the additional 
oil imports will come from the Middle East, the scene of most of the biggest supply 
disruptions in the past, and will transit vulnerable maritime routes to both eastern and 
western markets. Almost all Middle East oil and gas exports, for example, transit the 
Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf (Figure 3.11). Any supply disruption 
would  drive  up  prices  to  all  consuming  countries,  regardless  of  where  they  obtain 
their oil. The growing participation of China, India and other emerging countries in 
international  oil  trade  amplifies  the  importance  of  their  contribution  to  collective 
efforts to enhance global energy security (IEA, 2007).

CHAPTER 4
Chapter 4 - Natural gas market outlook
H I G H L I G H T S
NATURAL GAS MARKET OUTLOOK
World primary demand for natural gas expands by just over half between 2006   z
and 2030 in the Reference Scenario to 4.4 trillion cubic metres, a rate of increase 
of 1.8% per year. The share of gas in total world primary energy demand increases 
marginally, from 21% in 2006 to 22% in 2030. The projected growth in gas use is 
nonetheless slower than in last year’s Outlook — the result of higher assumed 
prices and less-rapid growth in gas-fired power generation.
The bulk of the increase in global gas use over the projection period — more than   z
three-quarters in total — comes from non-OECD regions, especially those that 
are well endowed with gas resources. Gas demand is projected to grow most in 
absolute terms in the Middle East. The pace of demand growth is fastest in China. 
Despite their much less rapid economic growth, North America and Europe still 
contribute a fifth of the global increase in gas demand. 
The power sector accounts for 57% of the projected increase in world gas demand to   z
2030, pushing up its share of global gas use from 39% now to 45%. The power sector is 
the main driver of gas demand in almost all regions, especially in non-OECD countries 
where electricity demand is projected to rise most rapidly. Despite the recent surge 
in price, gas remains competitive with other fuels in many cases, especially for mid-
load generation and where coal has to be imported. 
Gas resources are sufficient to meet the projected increase in global demand, but   z
production is set to become much more concentrated in the most resource-rich 
regions. Some 46% of the projected growth in world gas production in 2006-2030 
comes from the Middle East, its output tripling to around 1 tcm by 2030. About 60% of 
the region’s incremental output is consumed locally, mainly in power stations. Most 
of the remaining increase in world output is provided by Africa and Eastern Europe 
and Eurasia (mainly Russia). These capacity expansions hinge on timely investment. 
Inter-regional  natural  gas  trade  is  projected  to  more  than  double  over  the   z
projection period, from 441 billion cubic metres in 2006 to just over 1 tcm in 
2030. Imports rise in all the regions except non-Russia Eurasia that are currently 
net importers of gas, both in volume and as a share of their total gas consumption. 
The European Union sees the biggest increase in import volumes.  
Most of the growth in gas exports over 2006-2030 comes from the Middle East and   z
Africa. Together, they account for about 60% of total exports in 2030. Russia and 
the Caspian/Central Asian countries combined remain the other main exporting 
region. Most of the increase in inter-regional trade is in the form of liquefied 
natural gas, its share of trade rising from 52% in 2006 to 69% in 2030. Liquefaction 
capacity is set to expand markedly through to early in the 2010s, but a shortage 
could emerge thereafter if a wave of new investment is not sanctioned soon.

Demand
Global demand for natural gas is projected to increase by 52% between 2006 and 2030, 
from 2 916 bcm to 4 434 bcm (Table 4.1). Demand grows at an average annual rate of 
1.8%, 0.3 percentage points lower than was projected in last year’s Outlook. The share 
of gas in total world primary energy demand increases marginally, from 21% in 2006 to 
22% in 2030. In 1980, the share of gas was only 17%.

* Average annual rate of growth.
The projected rate of growth in global gas demand is lower than over the past quarter of 
a century: demand rose by 2.6% per year between 1980 and 2006. Demand began to slow 
at the turn of the century, rising by only 2.3% per year over 2000-2006. Warmer winter 
weather across the northern hemisphere, coupled with higher prices, largely offset the 
impact of relatively rapid economic growth worldwide over that period. The increase 
in prices in recent years has affected gas demand more than has been the case for oil, 
mainly because there is more scope for consumers to switch at short notice to other fuels, 
especially in power generation and industry (see Spotlight below). The much higher level of 
gas prices, in absolute terms and relative to coal prices (see Chapter 1), is the main reason 
for the downward revision in projected gas-demand growth. Slower GDP growth, especially 
in the big gas-consuming OECD regions, also contributes.

Are high prices choking off demand for gas?
The scope for gas consumers to reduce their consumption of gas in the face of 
high prices varies by region and by sector. Most residential consumers have little 
option but to pay the higher cost, as they rarely have any back up for space and 
water heating, and for cooking. Moreover, switching to an alternative fuel when 
installing new equipment may not be attractive since heating oil and electricity 
prices have also risen in most cases. But some gas-fired power plants and industrial 
boilers can be switched to other fuels at short notice (environmental regulations 
permitting), usually heavy fuel oil in the case of conventional steam boilers and 
distillate in the case of gas turbines. In addition, some utilities and manufacturers 
maintain back-up capacity that allows them to switch quickly to a cheaper fuel. 
Good  statistics  on  the  amount  of  such  flexible  capacity  and  the  extent  of 
switching in practice are rare outside the United States. The most recent survey 
of switching capacity in US manufacturing industry found that almost one-fifth 
of actual gas consumption could be avoided by switching to other fuels — a 
slightly lower share than in previous surveys (DOE/EIA, 2002). Roughly one-third 
of US power plants that use gas as the primary fuel were also able to run on oil 
products in 2007, even though most of the new gas-fired capacity added at the 
beginning of the current decade cannot use oil as a back up or alternative fuel.
There is evidence that the surge in gas prices in the United States and other OECD 
countries has prompted some switching from gas to oil and other fuels in recent 
years.  Usually,  this  switching  has  been  temporary.  The  share  of  gas  in  power 
generation  in  the  United  Kingdom,  for  example,  dropped  by  three  percentage 
points to 36% in 2006 in response to a spike in gas prices relative to coal prices, but 
rebounded to 42% in 2007 with higher coal prices. In some cases, where no fuel-
switching capacity exists, industrial production has stopped altogether — sometimes 
permanently. Since 2000, 26 of the 56 nitrogen fertilizer plants in the United States 
have shut down as a result of the higher cost of gas. Natural gas accounts for up 
to  90%  of  the  production  cost  of  ammonia  —  the  raw  material  for  all  nitrogen 
fertilizers. The use of gas as a petrochemical feedstock is growing much faster in 
non-OECD countries, especially the Middle East, with low-cost local supplies.
The decline in the gas intensity of economic activity worldwide has gathered 
pace since the beginning of the current decade, suggesting that higher prices 
are indeed tempering the growth in demand for gas (Figure 4.1). The decline in 
gas intensity has accelerated fastest on average in non-OECD countries — even 
though,  in  many  cases,  price  controls  have  prevented  much  of  the  increase 
in market prices from feeding through into retail prices. Gas is subsidised in 
most non-OECD countries — in some cases, heavily. In Russia, for example, gas 
subsidies to households and industry totalled close to $30 billion in 2007 (see 
Chapter 1). The reduction of these subsidies contributes to the acceleration of 
the decline in gas intensity in non-OECD countries over the period 2006-2030.

Regional trends
As with most other primary energy sources, the bulk of the increase in global gas use 
over the projection period — 76% in total — comes from non-OECD regions, especially 
those that are well endowed with gas resources (Figure 4.2). Gas demand is projected 
to grow most in absolute terms in the Middle East, where it jumps from 276 bcm in 
2006 to 676 bcm in 2030 — an increase of 145%. Rising local availability of gas supplies 
is  expected  to  fuel  this  expansion  in  demand,  most  of  which  comes  from  power 
generation and petrochemicals (for use as feedstock and heat generation). By 2030, 
the Middle East accounts for 15% of world gas consumption, compared with only 9% 
today and a mere 2% in 1980. Demand also grows strongly in non-OECD Asia, where gas 
captures market share from coal in industry. The pace of demand growth is fastest in

China, at close to 6% per year, and India, at nearly 5% per year. Yet the two countries’ 
combined share of world demand reaches only 8% in 2030, up from 3% in 2006, as they 
start from a low base. Demand rises much less quickly in Russia and in other Eastern 
European/Eurasian countries, mainly due to assumed progress in raising final prices 
to  market  levels,  improvements  in  end-use  energy  efficiency,  reduced  waste  and 
saturation effects. 
Despite  their  much  less  rapid  economic  growth,  North  America  and  Europe  both 
still account for a fifth of the overall growth in world gas use. With the exception of 
Eastern Europe/Eurasia and the Middle East, per-capita consumption in North America 
and Europe remains well above that of all other regions, for climate, economic and 
policy  reasons.  In  many  cases,  gas  continues  to  be  favoured  over  coal  and  oil  for 
environmental reasons, especially in power generation, where gas can be used in highly 
efficient combined-cycle gas turbines (see below). In Europe, carbon penalties under 
the EU Emissions Trading Scheme help gas to compete against more carbon-intensive 
coal in the power sector and heavy industry. 
Sectoral trends
Gas use is projected to become increasingly concentrated in power generation. The 
power sector accounts for 57% of the increase in world gas demand over the projection 
period (Figure 4.3). 1  As a result, the power sector’s share of global gas use rises from 
39% in 2006 to 45% in 2030. The power sector is the main driver of gas demand in almost 
all regions, especially in non-OECD countries where electricity demand is projected 
to rise most rapidly. Despite the recent surge in price, in many cases gas remains 
competitive with other fuels, especially for mid-load generation and where coal has to

be imported (see Chapter 6). The capital costs of combined-cycle gas turbines, which 
are much more efficient than coal-based power technologies, are lower than for coal-
fired power plants and the construction lead-times shorter. These factors compensate 
for higher fuel costs. In Europe, carbon penalties give gas an added cost advantage over 
coal for base-load generation. Nonetheless, renewables-based power technologies are 
expected to become increasingly competitive against gas over the projection period 
(see Chapter 7), slowing the rate of construction of gas-fired plants. 
Almost all of the rest of the increase in world primary gas demand to 2030 comes 
from end-use sectors, notably industry and the residential, services and agricultural 
sectors. Industry remains the single largest gas-consuming end-use sector, with demand 
projected to grow at 1.4% per year over 2006-2030. Industry’s share of total final gas 
demand rises from 35% in 2006 to 36% in 2030. Nonetheless, the share of gas in total 
industrial energy consumption falls slightly — mainly due to the increasing penetration 
of electricity, especially in non-OECD countries. Industrial gas use in the OECD barely 
increases, due to sluggish growth in heavy industrial production. 
As in industry, demand for gas in the residential, services and agricultural sectors grows 
relatively slowly. In OECD countries, the per-capita use of gas for space and water 
heating  and  for  cooking  is  approaching  saturation  levels.  With  population  growing 
only very slowly, this holds back the overall increase in gas demand in the residential, 
services and agricultural sectors to only 0.7% per year over the projection period. Gas 
consumption in these sectors grows more quickly, by an average of 2.2% per year in the 
non-OECD countries as a whole. Demand growth is particularly rapid in Asia. 
Gas-to-liquids (GTL) plants, which convert natural gas into high-quality oil products 
(as well as lubricants and petrochemical products), account for a small but growing 
share of global natural gas demand (Figure 4.4). The consumption of gas in such plants, 
mainly located in the Middle East and Africa, rises from only 5 bcm in 2006 to 33 bcm by 
2015 and over 50 bcm in 2030. There are three commercial-scale GTL plants operating 
today:  Oryx  in  Qatar,  which  started  up  in  2006;  Shell’s  Bintulu  plant  in  Malaysia 
which came on stream in 1993; and the Mossgas plant in South Africa, which has been

operating since 1990. Two more plants are under construction and others are planned. 
The long-term prospects for GTL hinge critically on bringing down costs, which have 
risen sharply in recent years, and on raising the thermal efficiency of the conversion 
process (see Chapter 11). 
Production 2
The proximity of reserves to markets and the level of production costs will continue 
to drive regional prospects for gas supply. Gas transportation, whether by pipeline 
or as liquefied natural gas (LNG), remains very expensive and usually represents a 
significant share of the overall cost of gas delivered to consumers. A substantial part of 
the world’s gas resources is located far from the main centres of demand and cannot 
yet be extracted profitably. Those resources are unquestionably large enough to meet 
the projected increase in global demand in the Reference Scenario. It is assumed here 
that the necessary investment in the infrastructure required to bring them to market 
will be made in a timely manner, though this is an area of risk (Box 4.1).
Some  46%  of  the  projected  growth  in  world  gas  production  over  the  Outlook 
period  comes  from  the  Middle  East,  its  output  tripling  to  around  1  tcm  by  2030 
(Table 4.2 and Figure 4.5). That region holds the largest reserves and has the lowest

production  costs,  whether  or  not  the  gas  is  produced  in  association  with  oil. 
Iran,  Qatar,  Iraq  and  Saudi  Arabia  account  for  most  of  the  increase.  About  60% 
of  incremental  output  is  consumed  locally,  mainly  in  power  stations,  while  the 
remainder is exported (see below). Most of the remaining increase in world output 
is provided by Africa and Eastern Europe/Eurasia (mainly Russia). The latter region 
remains the largest single producing region in 2030, just ahead of the Middle East. 
Production rises marginally in OECD North America over 2006-2030, mainly due to 
non-conventional supplies (notably shale gas), but falls heavily in Europe where North 
Sea reserves continue to dwindle. Australia accounts for virtually all of the projected 
increase in OECD Pacific output.

Box 4.1 z  Adequacy of gas-supply infrastructure and risks of shortages
The rigidity of gas-supply chains and the lengthening lead times in building 
physical infrastructure increase the risk that demand may, at times, outstrip 
available capacity. As the 2007 issue of the IEA’s Natural Gas Market Review 
put  it  “The  world  dodged  a  bullet”  in  the  winter  of  2006/2007:  delays  in 
bringing  new  capacity  on  stream  did  not  lead  to  shortages  in  Europe  and 
North  America,  mainly  thanks  to  warmer-than-normal  weather,  which 
dampened  demand  (IEA,  2007).  Yet  concerns  remain  that  investment  in 
upstream  facilities,  LNG  chains  and  long-distance  pipelines,  in  the  medium 
term, may fall short of that needed to meet growing demand, especially if 
power generators opt to build more gas-fired capacity than the high levels 
already projected (for example, if gas prices are lower than assumed). It is 
generally quicker to build gas-fired capacity than the infrastructure required 
to supply it. Limited spare capacity within the gas-supply system increases 
the risk of physical shortages occurring due to a sudden supply disruption 
or an exceptional surge in demand, for weather-related or other reasons.

Box 4.1 z  Adequacy of gas-supply infrastructure and risks of shortages 
(continued)
Recent supply problems in several markets have refocused attention on gas-
supply  security.  The  loss  of  US  gas-production  capacity  through  hurricane 
damage  in  2005  resulted  in  a  surge  in  prices  that  choked  off  a  substantial 
amount of industrial demand, rebalancing the market. The high degree of inter-
connectivity of the North American network enabled supplies to be redirected. 
In the event, no customer was forced to stop using gas. But other countries 
that have not liberalised their gas markets to the same degree cannot rely on 
market forces to bring demand back into balance with supply during a crisis. 
In the winter of “2005/2006”, cold weather and higher-than-usual use of gas 
for power generation led to a surge in demand in Italy. A lack of cross-border 
capacity and fixed prices to most customers resulted in physical shortages that 
could only be addressed through plant closures through administrative decree, 
the temporary relaxation of environmental standards to allow fuel oil to be used 
instead of gas and rationing. Commercial disputes with neighbouring countries 
have recently led to disruptions in Russian gas supplies to Europe. These incidents 
have highlighted the importance of giving full rein to markets in balancing supply 
and demand in the event of a crisis, and to the need for timely and adequate 
investment in transmission and storage capacity. 
There are particular concerns about the adequacy of investment in LNG capacity 
in the medium term. An unprecedented major expansion is underway worldwide 
in regasification capacities, well in excess of LNG-production capacity. As a 
result, global regasification capacity is likely to be under-utilised, even though 
its availability will increase supply flexibility. 3  But liquefaction capacity is not 
expected  to  increase  as  quickly.  Although  a  significant  amount  of  capacity 
is planned and proposed, many projects have yet to be formally sanctioned. 
Major delays and cost over-runs afflict many projects that have been given 
the green light, which has discouraged companies from proceeding to final 
investment decisions on other projects and has led to some cancellations. The 
dearth of investment decisions in new LNG projects since mid-2005 means that 
any new surge of investment is unlikely to result in additional capacity, beyond 
that due in service by 2012, being available before 2015, given the long lead 
times  involved.  Notwithstanding  the  massive  expansion  in  LNG  supply  that 
will undoubtedly occur by 2012, the lag in LNG investment beyond 2012 raises 
questions about the availability of incremental LNG supply for both OECD and 
non-OECD importing countries. Shortfalls in the availability of LNG could push 
up prices and encourage the faster development of indigenous resources in 
importing regions.
3.  There has already been  an increase in inter-regional swaps of LNG cargoes, particularly from the Atlantic 
to Paciﬁ c regions, facilitated by growing supplies and changing business models in the LNG industry.

Inter-regional trade
Inter-regional  natural  gas  trade  (between  major  WEO  regions)  is  projected  to  more 
than double over the projection period, from 441 bcm in 2006 to around 1 tcm in 2030 
(Table 4.3). Trade rises much faster than demand, due to the pronounced geographical 
mismatch  between  resource  location  and  demand.  As  a  result,  regional  gas  markets 
become more integrated as trade in LNG expands and new long-distance and undersea 
pipelines enable more gas to be traded between regions. 
Imports rise in all the regions (with the exception of non-Russia Eurasia) that are currently 
net importers of gas, both in volume and as a share of total gas consumption (Table 4.3). 
The European Union sees the biggest increase in net import volumes, from 305 bcm in 2006 
to about 580 bcm in 2030. Its reliance on imports rises from 57% of its total gas needs to 86% 
over that period. Most of the increase is met by Russia, Africa and the Middle East. North 
America, which is almost self-sufficient in gas at present, emerges as a major importing 
region during the projection period as demand outpaces production. Imports from Africa, 
Latin  America  and  the  Middle  East,  mostly  into  the  United  States,  reach  a  combined 
140 bcm in 2030. OECD Asia (Japan and Korea) is already highly reliant on imports to meet 
its gas needs. Its net imports, from non-OECD Asian countries, the Middle East, Australia 
and Russia (Sakhalin), rise by more than half between 2006 and 2030. Imports into China 
also increase sharply, covering just under half of the country’s gas needs in 2030. India’s 
imports also grow markedly, meeting more than 60% of total gas demand by 2030.
Most of the additional exports over 2006-2030 come from the Middle East and Africa. 
Together,  they  account  for  59%  of  total  gas  exports  in  2030.  Exports  from  Africa 
are projected to almost triple, from 99 bcm in 2006 to over 280 bcm in 2030, while 
those from the Middle East increase six-fold, from 55 bcm to about 320 bcm. African 
countries’ exports to Europe grow strongly. The Middle East increases its net exports to 
all the main consuming markets except China: Europe, North America, OECD Asia and 
India. Most of the additional exports from Africa and the Middle East are in the form 
of LNG. Russia and the Caspian/Central Asian countries collectively make up the other 
main exporting region. This region increases its exports to Europe by 14% and starts to 
export to China and OECD Asia. Russia’s total net exports rise from 198 bcm in 2006 
to 270 bcm in 2030. Apart from the Sakhalin project, all exports from Russia and the 
Caspian/Central Asia are via pipeline.
Worldwide, LNG flows have doubled in the past decade and now meet 7% of total 
world demand for natural gas. The share of LNG in total trade between WEO regions 
continues to grow steadily through the Outlook period, from 52% in 2006 to 69% in 2030 
(Figure 4.7). 4  The volume of LNG trade reaches 340 bcm in 2015 and around 680 bcm 
in 2030 — up from only 201 bcm in 2006. LNG accounts for 80% of the increase in inter-
regional trade.
4.  The share of LNG in total international trade is signiﬁ cantly lower, as most intra-regional trade is by 
pipeline. LNG is generally the cheaper means of transport over long distances.

*Trade from major WEO regions, not including international trade within each region.
The pattern of world LNG trade is set to change markedly. Until now, LNG trade has 
been confined largely to the Asia-Pacific region, with gas sourced within Asia and in 
the Middle East. Although this market continues to expand, LNG demand from Atlantic 
Basin  markets  increases  even  more  over  the  projection  period,  so  that  flows  from 
Africa and the Middle East to Europe and North America quickly overtake those flowing 
eastwards. OPEC countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East, dominate the 
growth in supply of LNG through to 2030 (Figure 4.8). At the end of 2007, there were 
24 liquefaction terminals in operation worldwide, with a total capacity of 256 bcm per 
year. An additional 146 bcm/year of capacity is under construction, which will take 
total capacity to around 400 bcm/year by 2012 (Table 4.4). Another 417 bcm/year of 
capacity is in the planning stage, though many of the planned projects have been on 
the table for several years. If only half of this planned capacity is built, total capacity 
would reach over 600 bcm/year.

CHAPTER 5
123 Chapter 5 - Coal market outlook
COAL MARKET OUTLOOK
z  Since 2000, global coal consumption has grown faster than any other fuel, 
despite higher prices, by 4.9% per year between 2000 and 2006. Most of this 
growth occurred in non-OECD countries. Coal demand is projected to grow by 
2% per year over the Outlook period, faster than total energy demand. Non-
OECD countries account for 97% of the increase in global coal demand over the 
Outlook period, with China alone accounting for two-thirds of the increase and 
India for a further 19%. 
z   To meet growing demand, coal production is projected to rise by almost 60% 
between 2006 and 2030. Around 90% of this increase comes from non-OECD 
countries. China almost doubles its output, while India’s production more than 
doubles. Russian production jumps by nearly 75%, overtaking that of OECD 
Europe. 
z   Proven remaining reserves are more than adequate to meet the growth in coal 
use projected to 2030. The United States, Russia and China together account 
for around 60% of world reserves. However, large investments are needed in 
prospecting (to identify economically recoverable reserves) and in new mining 
projects.
z   Global trade in coal between WEO regions rises from 613 million tonnes of coal 
equivalent today to around 980 Mtce by 2030. Despite a sharp decline in its coal 
exports, China remains a net exporter at present, but becomes a net importer 
in the near future, with net imports rising to 88 Mtce by 2030. India’s imports 
grow by 7% per year to 220 Mtce, overtaking Europe to become the world’s 
second-largest net importer after OECD Asia.
z   Coal prices have kept pace with increases in oil and natural gas prices in recent 
years. The spot price of steam coal delivered to ports in Europe and Asia rose 
to above $100 per tonne in 2007 and continued to rise steeply in 2008. Coal-
supply costs have also risen dramatically, due to sharp increases in the cost 
of materials, equipment, diesel, labour and shipping. Projected cumulative 
investment in coal-supply infrastructure totals about $730 billion between 2007 
and 2030 (in year-2007 dollars), 91% of which is required for mines, and the rest 
for ports and shipping.
z   Carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  coal  combustion  are  set  to  rise  from  11.7 
gigatonnes in 2006 to 18.6 Gt in 2030, driving up coal’s share of total emissions 
from 42% to 46%. Carbon capture and storage technology has the potential to 
reduce greatly CO
2
 emissions from coal use in the long term, but has only a 
small impact before 2030 in the Reference Scenario.

Demand
Globally, coal consumption grew briskly between 2000 and 2006, at 4.9% per annum — 
a rate well above that of total energy demand, which grew by 2.6% per year. Coal 
demand grew faster even than the use of modern renewables, which rose at a rate 
of  3.1%  per  annum  (Figure  5.1).  Coal  is  the  world’s  second  most  important  fuel, 
after oil, accounting for 26% of global energy demand. Global coal demand reached 
4 362 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2006. The world’s five largest coal 
consumers  —  China,  the  United  States,  India,  Japan  and  Russia  —  account  for  72% 
of total coal consumption. Between 2000 and 2006, coal demand in OECD member 
countries grew on average by just 0.6% per year, its share of global demand dropping 
to  37%  in  2006,  down  from  48%  in  2000.  Preliminary  2007  data  shows  a  renewed 
increase in OECD demand of 2.1% — twice the rate of growth of total primary energy.

The pace of coal growth is projected to slow over the Outlook period, to 3.1% per year 
on  average  through  to  2015  and  1.3%  thereafter  to  2030  (Table  5.1).  Despite  this 
slowdown as users switch to less carbon-intensive alternatives, coal demand grows 
faster than overall energy demand. Coal consumption increases by 32% by 2015 and by 
61% from 2006 to 2030, reaching 7 011 Mtce. The projected increase in coal consumption 
to 2030, at 2 649 Mtce, is almost equal to the combined coal consumption of all non-
OECD countries today. With this strong growth, the share of coal in total energy supply 
rises from 26% in 2006 to 29% by around 2025, before levelling off through to 2030 as the 
growth in other fuels, particularly for power generation, eats into coal’s market share. 
The detailed analysis in last year’s Outlook of China and India, two of the world’s largest 
coal  consumers,  led  to  a  significant  increase  in  projected  global  coal  consumption 
compared  with  previous  WEOs.  In  comparison,  this  year’s  Outlook  projects  lower 
coal demand in OECD countries, due to recent delays in the construction of coal-fired 
power plants in the European Union and the United States, for environmental reasons, 
and  because  of  a  shift  to  natural  gas  and  renewable  energy  in  power  generation.

This is offset by slightly higher coal demand in non-OECD countries, driven by a greater 
emphasis there on economic factors and stronger growth in electricity demand. Overall, 
projected coal demand in 2030 is slightly lower than in last year’s Outlook, in line with 
recent rises in coal prices and the higher coal-price assumptions for the Outlook period.

The  OECD  is  projected  to  see  an  initial  minor  increase  in  coal  consumption,  from 
1 627 Mtce in 2006 to about 1 730 Mtce in 2015, then a drop to just over 1 700 Mtce in 
2030. Growth over the projection period averages only 0.2% per year, reflecting policies 
aimed at reducing carbon-dioxide (CO
2
) emissions. The share of coal in total OECD 
primary energy use drops from 21% today to 19% by 2030, driven mainly by a sharp drop 
in the share of coal as an input to power generation, from 41% today to 36% by 2030, 
as natural gas, biomass and waste, and other renewables all increase their share. In 
contrast with the situation in OECD Europe, the availability of low-cost, indigenous coal 
in OECD North America favours modest demand growth. The industrial sector in the 
OECD continues to become less coal intensive, with coal use actually falling by 0.6% per 
year over the projection period. Most coal use in OECD countries is still used in power 
generation: the sector’s share of total coal use is the same in 2030 as in 2006, at 81%.
Switching  from  gas-fired  to  coal-fired  power  generation  remains  economically 
attractive in Russia, leading to a rise in coal demand of over 50% over the projection 
period,  to  reach  233  Mtce  by  2030.  China  and  India  both  see  strong  growth  in 
coal  consumption.  China  alone  will  account  for  two-thirds  of  the  global  increase

OECD  countries  in  total  account  for  97%  of  the  global  increase  in  coal  demand, 
mainly to meet rising electricity demand. China consumes 40% of the world’s coal 
today  and  this  share  rises  to  50%  by  2030.  Its  demand  rises  at  an  average  rate  of 
3%  per  year.  India  sees  the  world’s  second-fastest  coal  growth  of  4.1%  per  year 
over  the  projection  period.  Although  insignificant  in  global  terms,  coal  demand  in 
the  Middle  East  is  forecast  to  grow  strongly  by  4.4%  per  year  as  coal-fired  power 
generation allows oil and gas to be used for more valuable applications or exported.
Most of the coal consumed today worldwide is for power generation and this is not 
expected to change. This sector accounted for over two-thirds of global consumption 
in 2006, a share that remains broadly flat through to 2030 (Figure 5.2). Coal use in 
power generation increases at 2% per year. This overall average masks the intermediate 
trend of an increasing share of coal in power generation through to 2020, before falling 
back to 2006 levels by the end of the Outlook period. Industry remains the second 
largest consumer of coal, though growth in industrial coal use slows dramatically in 
the second half of the projection period, from 2.9% per year in 2006-2015 to 1.1% per 
year in 2015-2030. This is caused by the projected levelling out in non-OECD countries, 
particularly China, of iron production from blast furnaces, which is very coal intensive. 
Recycled scrap accounts for an increasing share of steel production, particularly from 
electric arc furnaces, indirectly creating demand for coal in the power sector. Coal 
use in the residential, services and agriculture sectors as a whole is projected to fall.

The extent and effectiveness of policy action to reduce the carbon intensity of energy 
consumption, in order to mitigate climate change, remains the principal uncertainty 
for future trends in coal demand. Another factor that greatly affects coal’s prospects 
is the cost differential between coal and gas for power generation. While coal is the

cheapest  way  to  generate  electricity  in  many  regions  (see  Chapter  6),  particularly 
where it is domestically available, the widespread introduction of a carbon value (such 
as under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme) could significantly reduce the attractiveness 
of  investing  in  coal  plants,  resulting  in  lower  coal  demand  than  projected  here.
In  2006,  CO
2
  emissions  from  coal  use  totalled  11.7  Gt,  equal  to  42%  of  global 
energy-related  CO
2
  emissions  (Figure  5.3).  This  share  is  ten  percentage  points 
higher than the share of coal in total primary fossil-energy use, due to the higher 
carbon  intensity  of  coal  compared  to  oil  and  gas.  Global  CO 2   emissions  from  coal 
are  projected  to  rise  by  2%  per  year  over  the  Outlook  period,  reaching  18.6  Gt 
in  2030.  Coal’s  share  of  CO 2   emissions  rises  to  46%.  The  absolute  increase  in  coal 
emissions  is  slightly  larger  than  the  level  of  current  emissions  from  all  fossil-fuel 
use  in  OECD  North  America.  Coal  use  also  results  in  emissions  of  other  types  of 
greenhouse gases (see Chapter 16), as well as other toxic and pollutant gases, which 
can  have  serious  effects  on  the  local  environment  and  human  health.  Concerted 
efforts  to  combat  climate  change  —  including  switching  to  lower-carbon  fuels  and 
the widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage technology — could lead 
to  much  lower  emissions  than  projected  in  the  Reference  Scenario  (see  Part  C).

Reserves and production
Coal is the most abundant and geographically dispersed fossil fuel. Proven reserves at 
the end of 2005 were 847 billion tonnes (WEC, 2007). The United States, Russia and 
China combined account for 61% of proven reserves (Figure 5.4). Australia, the world’s 
largest coal exporter, has 9% of the world’s proven reserves, while the second-largest 
exporter, Indonesia, has less than 1%. Around half of the world’s proven reserves are 
bituminous coal and anthracite, the grade of coal with the highest energy content. 
Current reserves are more than adequate to meet projected growth in coal demand 
through to 2030 in this Outlook. However the rapid increase in demand in recent years 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
128 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
has seen the global reserves-to-production ratio fall sharply, from 188 years in 2002 
to 144 years in 2005 (WEC, 2007 and 2004). This fall can be attributed to the lack 
of incentives to prove up reserves, rather than a lack of coal resources. Exploration 
activity  is  typically  carried  out  by  mining  companies  with  short  planning  horizons, 
rather  than  by  state-funded  geological  surveys.  With  no  economic  need  to  prove 
long-term reserves, the ratio of proven reserves to production is likely to fall further.

Between 2006 and 2030, world coal production is projected to rise by almost 60%, 
or over 2 610 Mtce (Table 5.2). The United States remains far and away the biggest 
producer in the OECD, its production rising by 19% between 2006 and 2030. Production 
in  OECD  Europe  continues  its  steady  decline.  The  removal  of  subsidies,  notably  in 
Germany,  leads  to  the  closure  of  high-cost  mines.  Coal  output  in  OECD  Pacific  is 
projected to grow at 1.6% per year, almost all of the growth occurring in Australia. 
In  order  to  meet  domestic  coal  demand,  coal  production  in  non-OECD  countries 
grows  significantly,  expanding  at  2.5%  per  year.  Non-OECD  countries  account 
for  91%  of  the  increase  in  world  coal  production  over  the  Outlook  period.  China 
almost  doubles  its  current  coal  production,  though  growth  slows  after  2015. 
In India, output increases by a factor of 2.1. Robust growth in production in Russia 
sees  it  overtake  OECD  Europe  around  2010  and  continue  to  expand  thereafter.
The  projected  growth  in  coal  production  and  use  in  China  and  India  in  the 
Reference  Scenario  hinges  on  the  way  those  countries  address  several  challenges, 
including  local  and  global  environmental  impacts  (see  Part  C).  At  the  local  level, 
the water and other infrastructure demands of coal mining in arid regions of China’s 
northwest  will  place  enormous  strains  on  a  delicate  ecosystem;  in  India,  the  loss 
of forests and villages, and the displacement of people, make any expansion of its 
largely  open-cast  coal  industry  politically  challenging.  The  Chinese  government 
has  identified  coal  mining  as  a  strategic  sector  and  the  industry  is  currently

profitable with ample funds for investment. Proving coal reserves and installing the 
transport  infrastructure  to  move  large  volumes  of  coal  over  ever-longer  distances 
are practical challenges that China has already demonstrated it can surmount with 
the development of coalfields in northern Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia. The 
investment  requirements,  though  large  in  absolute  terms,  are  small  relative  to 
China’s  whole  energy  sector.  In  India,  the  projected  expansion  of  output  assumes 
that  the  coal  sector,  dominated  by  Coal  India,  becomes  more  competitive.

130 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Steam  coal,  used  mainly  in  power  generation,  will  remain  the  main  type  of  coal 
produced  worldwide.  Output  is  projected  to  grow  by  2.2%  per  year  and  its  share 
of total coal output to rise from 77% in 2006 to 81% in 2030, driven by power generation 
in Asia. The projected growth of coking coal, at 1.3% per year, is roughly in line with the 
1.7% per year coal growth projected in the iron and steel sector (the main consumer) 
over the Outlook period. Use of brown coal and peat also grows slowly, by 1.2% per year.
Box 5.1 z  Alternative energy supplies: underground coal gasification 
and coal-mine methane 1
Underground  coal  gasification  (UCG)  offers  the  prospect  of  bringing  more 
of  the  world’s  coal  resources  to  market,  not  as  a  solid  fuel,  but  as  a  clean 
gaseous  fuel.  Conventional  underground  coal  mining  becomes  more  difficult 
and more expensive as mining depth increases. Mining below 1 000 metres is 
generally  not  economic.  Yet  60%  of  China’s  coal  resources,  for  example,  lie 
below  1  000  metres  (Pan,  2005).  In  addition,  coal  lying  offshore  is  generally 
not practical to mine, but could be exploited using UCG. Estimates of the coal 
resources suitable for UCG vary widely, but a conservative estimate suggests 
that they could yield the equivalent of 146 trillion cubic metres (WEC, 2007) — 
similar in magnitude to the world’s current conventional natural gas reserves.
UCG draws on technologies, developed in the oil and gas industry, to drill into 
coal seams, introduce an oxidant to combust some coal, and create a hot cavity 
in which more coal is gasified with steam. The resulting gas (mainly hydrogen 
and carbon monoxide, with a smaller quantity of methane) is drawn off to fuel 
a gas turbine for large-scale power generation or as feedstock for chemical or 
liquid fuel production. UCG was practised on a large scale in the former Soviet 
Union from the early 1960s, with one site in Uzbekistan remaining in production 
to supply a 400 MW power plant. Subsequent trials in Europe and the United 
States, and more recently in China, Australia and South Africa, have not yet led 
to any commercial UCG projects. But the prospects for UCG are tempting enough 
to have attracted some private investment, notably by Linc Energy of Australia.
The technical challenge with UCG is to control the hot cavity so that it moves 
along within the coal seam and converts as much coal as possible into useful fuel 
gas. Developments in directional drilling over the last decade mean that this 
challenge can be overcome and an efficient drilling pattern established to recover 
the maximum amount of energy. The seismic and hydrogeological skills needed to 
design UCG projects are to be found in the oil and gas industry, though they are 
in short supply. Environmental concerns relate mainly to the fate of hazardous 
by-products. In well-designed schemes, these are handled in surface treatment 
plants or remain immobile within the gasified coal seam. The prospects for UCG 
are  improving,  as  energy  prices  rise  and  technology  develops.  But  until  it  is 
demonstrated on a commercial scale, it remains only an interesting prospect: it is 
not assumed to have a material impact on energy supplies over the Outlook period.

Coal-mine methane (CMM) involves capturing methane released from the coal 
seam and surrounding strata before or during coal mining. In underground mines, 
ventilation must be sufficient to keep the methane concentration low enough to 
avoid explosions. Since the build up of methane can slow mining, it is common 
practice to pre-drill coal seams and draw off methane before mining. The purity 
of the captured methane, typically of the order of 35% to 75% (Creedy and Tilley, 
2003), means it can be used on-site for power generation, sold for local use or 
purified for sale as pipeline gas, although the latter option is only viable for larger 
projects. It is also possible to collect methane from the “gob” areas left behind 
after coal extraction. The methane content of coal can reach 25 cubic metres 
per tonne, increasing with depth and coal rank. Although the average value might 
be around 5 m 3  per tonne, methane release per tonne of coal mined is much 
larger, since more coal is disturbed during mining than is actually extracted. 2 An 
estimated 28 bcm of methane was released in 2005 during coal mining worldwide, 
or 6% of total global methane emissions from human activity (EPA, 2006).
In  developing  countries,  CMM  projects  can  benefit  from  Clean  Development 
Mechanism  credits  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  This  has  led  to  a  wave  of  new 
projects  in  China,  where  the  value  of  avoided  methane  emissions  can  be 
significant. Methane has a global warming potential at least 21 times that of 
CO
2
, so even simple projects that flare rather than vent methane can have a 
significant environmental and financial value.
Inter-regional trade 3
Global trade in hard coal between WEO regions in 2006 amounted to 613 Mtce, or 14% of 
total hard coal output (Table 5.3). Trade is projected to grow at 2.0% per year through 
to 2030, reaching almost 980 Mtce. Trade grows quickest in the period until 2015, 
at 3.1% per year. Trade grows slightly slower than demand, as most coal continues 
to be consumed within the region in which it is produced.  As a result, the share of 
global  hard  coal  output  that  is  traded  between  WEO  regions  remains  flat  at  14%. 
Major demand centres in non-OECD countries, China and India, see rapid growth in 
imports over the projection period (Figure 5.6). China was a net exporter with a peak of 
87 Mtce in 2001, but net exports have declined and China is expected to become a net 
importer in the near future. Total net imports are projected to reach 88 Mtce by 2030. 
India’s net imports also grow strongly, by 7% per year, resulting in India overtaking OECD 
Europe to become the world’s second-largest net importing region after OECD Asia. 
Europe’s imports rise through to the middle of the projection period, but then fall back 
by 2030 to a level close to that of today, as coal demand for power generation drops.
Russia is currently the world’s third-largest net-exporting country. At the higher prices 
assumed in this Outlook compared with last year, Russian exports are very competitive, 
2.  IPCC (2006) guidelines suggest a range of 10-25 m 3  per tonne of coal mined from underground 
when reporting emissions, before accounting for any methane captured.

despite the long rail-transport distances from the Kuzbass coalfields of central Russia 
to  ports  serving  the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  markets.  There  are  plans  to  expand  port 
capacities, with exports to the Far East expected to grow quickly from a low base. 
Production can easily be expanded to meet both rising domestic demand and export 
growth.

Note: Trade between WEO regions only. Positive figures denote exports; negative figures imports. 
Inter-regional trade between WEO regions differs from total international trade, which includes trade 
within regions.
Australia remains the world’s largest coal-exporting country. Australia, with ample low-
cost reserves, has the potential to meet much of the increased demand for internationally 
traded coal. Infrastructure development will be crucial to realise this potential. Recent 
announcements of port expansion projects in Queensland and New South Wales are a step 
in this direction and other projects are likely to follow, including those that boost rail 
capacity. Given their higher value, coking-coal exports will be particularly important, 
especially if infrastructure development does not keep pace because of local opposition.
Indonesia’s coal sector has repeatedly shown its ability to meet rising international 
demand for steam coal. Production is expected to continue to increase with modest 
investment expected in rail infrastructure to access coal resources lying beyond what

it is practical to transport with the current combination of trucks and river barges. 
Nonetheless, net exports grow only modestly, as rapid growth in domestic demand 
absorbs most of the projected increase in production.

* Steam and coking coal, and coke.
OECD North America remains an important coal exporter throughout the projection 
period. US coal exports have dwindled since the 1990s, but are now growing strongly 
in  response  to  very  high  coking-coal  prices  and  European  demand  for  steam  coal. 
The United States is expected to remain a swing supplier in the international market, 
helping to meet demand and thus dampening prices. Western Canadian coking-coal 
producers are enjoying a revival and have a number of new projects planned. Long 
rail-transport  distances  from  the  coalfields  to  ports  mean  that  Canadian  coking 
coal  is  likely  to  remain  less  attractive  economically  than  Australian  coking  coal. 
Africa  remains  an  important  net  exporter  over  the  projection  period.  South 
Africa is expanding its principal coal-export terminal at Richards Bay to 91 million 
tonnes  (Mt)  and  producers  are  optimistic  about  boosting  exports,  despite  a  recent 
period  of  limited  growth  and  even  decline.  Fully  utilising  this  capacity  hinges  on 
investment  in  rail  infrastructure,  to  expand  capacity  and  to  extend  the  network 
to  new  producing  regions.  Domestic  coal  demand  is  buoyant  with  the  re-opening 
by  Eskom  in  2008  of  coal-fired  power  stations  to  meet  strong  electricity  demand 
growth. Consequently, we project only a modest rise in exports to 2030. Mozambique 
becomes a coking-coal exporter by 2010 with the launch of a project by the Brazilian 
company  Vale.  This  trend  towards  upstream  coal-supply  investment  by  coal  users 
is  also  seen  amongst  some  European  power  utilities.  China  has  also  followed 
this  route,  with  its  largest  coal  producer,  Shenhua,  now  investing  in  Indonesia. 
Colombia is well placed to supply customers in the Atlantic steam coal market, filling 
demand  left  unmet  by  South  African  producers.  It  appears  likely  that  the  major 
private  coal  companies  will  work  closely  with  government  to  ensure  that  new  rail

134 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
infrastructure and roads are built to allow exports to grow to well over 100 Mt per year. 
Venezuela has the potential to export considerably more than its current 8 Mt per year. 
A deepwater port, linked to Vale’s Socuy project, could see exports grow to 25 Mt. 
Latin American exports are projected to increase by over 40% between today and 2030.
China’s net position in the international coal market is highly uncertain. It has the 
infrastructure  and  reserves  to  export  hundreds  of  millions  of  tonnes  per  year  and 
exports did grow sharply during the late 1990s, through to a peak in 2003 of 101 Mtce 
(net  of  imports,  they  peaked  at  87  Mtce  in  2001).  The  country  is  well  placed  to 
supply Japanese and South Korean markets. However, to ensure that strong domestic 
demand is met, the government has imposed export restrictions in the form of taxes 
and annual quotas on the four companies holding export licences. As China continues 
its market reforms, the domestic price of coal should better reflect its true value in 
the global market and allow China’s balance of coal imports and exports to reach a 
natural level. Vietnam has been an important supplier to China in recent years, but 
rising  domestic  demand  and  limited  resources  will  see  this  trend  reverse  over  the 
Outlook  period.  Mongolia  is  already  developing  mines  and  infrastructure  to  meet 
demand from China. We expect Mongolian coal exports to China to increase rapidly.
Coal prices and supply costs
Coal  prices  have  kept  pace  with  the  surge  in  international  oil  and  gas  prices 
(Figure 5.7), although on an energy basis, coal remains the cheapest fossil fuel. For 
example, the average price of steam coal imported into the European Union in 2007 
was $3 per MBtu, compared with $8.80 per MBtu for imported high-sulphur fuel oil, 
$7.30 per MBtu for natural gas imported by pipeline and $6.50 per MBtu for liquefied 
natural  gas.  During  2007  and  2008,  coal  prices  repeatedly  reached  historic  highs. 
Asian and European marker prices doubled in 2007 to above $100 per tonne CIF and 
have risen further during the first half of 2008, to above $200 per tonne in Europe.
While  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  influence  coal  prices  through  contractual  linkages 
and opportunities for fuel switching, notably in power generation, there are many 
other factors which have contributed to higher prices. Supply has been tight during 
a  period  of  unprecedented  demand  growth.  Unforeseen  events  in  late  2007  and 
early  2008  have  added  to  this  tightness:  flooding  of  mines  in  Australia,  electricity 
shortages  in  South  Africa  and  a  temporary  halt  to  all  Chinese  coal  exports  as  the 
Chinese  government  sought  to  ensure  that  domestic  demand  was  met.  Strong 
demand for steel production and power generation has seen the world’s bulk carrier 
shipping fleet struggle to meet demand to transport iron ore, coking coal, coke and 
steam  coal.  Shipping  rates  rose  steeply  during  2007  and  have  been  very  volatile 
during 2008, touching an historic high in May. However, freight rates may now fall 
as  the  number  of  new  vessels  earmarked  for  commissioning  between  2008  and 
2013  exceeds  projected  demand  (Rogers,  2007).  High  coking-coal  prices  have  had 
a knock-on impact on the price of good-quality steam coal, which can be used as a 
substitute in some cases. These factors, coupled with rising production costs, have

contributed to higher prices in real terms. In fact, the increase has been bigger than 
that experienced during the mid-1970s to early 1980s, when coal prices last peaked.

The steam-coal supply-cost curve (Figure 5.8) has shifted up sharply in recent years. 
Although the curve shows average cash costs (excluding capital depreciation costs) for 
each of the major coal-exporting countries, individual mine costs can vary widely. For 
example, Australian exporters operate across a broad range, with costs as low as $20 
to more than $50 per tonne. At the high end, steam coal may be sold as a by-product 
of  high-cost  deep  mines  producing  coking  coal  as  a  primary  product.  Indonesia, 
South Africa, Venezuela and Colombia all export coal produced at an average cost 
of  around  $30  per  tonne,  but  individual  mines  range  from  $20  to  $40  per  tonne.
The  reasons  for  cost  increases  in  recent  years  have  included  escalating  material 
costs (including tyres, explosives, spare parts and steel products), rising labour costs, 
depletion of the lowest-cost reserves, increased stripping ratios at open-cast mines 
and,  in  some  cases,  longer  transport  distances  (Meister,  2008).  Labour  costs  have 
risen everywhere, by as little as 5% in the United States to more than 40% in South 
Africa  between  2003  and  2008.  Rising  oil  prices  have  had  a  particular  impact  on 
open-cast mining, as widely practiced in Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, India, South 
Africa, Venezuela and the United States. Diesel fuel is essential for open-cast mining, 
particularly  operations  that  rely  heavily  on  mechanical  shovels  for  extraction  and 
trucks for coal haulage. While open-cast mining costs are generally lower than deep 
mining, diesel consumption can account for 20% of the total cash cost at open-cast 
operations. The cost of diesel to mining companies has risen by 100% to 500% in most 
coal-exporting countries since 2003, with Indonesia at the upper end of this range. 
Some of the increase in non-OECD countries is due to the removal of subsidies on diesel.

Despite these significant cost increases, a large margin remains between coal prices 
and  costs,  which  is  attracting  new  investment  into  the  industry  and  is  stimulating 
considerable  merger  and  acquisition  activity,  notably  BHP  Billiton’s  proposed 
acquisition of Rio Tinto. This should help overcome one of the factors behind tight 
coal  supply;  but  new  capacity  will  take  several  years  to  come  on  line  and,  with 
demand  growth  remaining  strong,  prices  are  expected  to  remain  high  in  the  short 
term. Further concentration of the industry, particularly amongst suppliers of coking 
coal, works against a competitive investment climate and explains why, while some 
coal  users  are  investing  upstream,  others  are  turning  to  competition  regulators.
Coal investment
The  overall  investment  needs  of  the  coal  industry  were  examined  in  detail  in 
WEO-2003,  when  it  was  estimated  that  $400  billion  (year-2000  dollars)  would 
be  required  over  the  period  2001-2030.  Since  then,  capital  costs  have  increased 
significantly,  with  rising  steel  prices  and  engineering  costs.  In  WEO-2003,  the 
average  mine  was  assumed  to  require  investment  of  $34  per  tonne  of  annual 
capacity (in year-2000 dollars). In this Outlook, we assume a $50 per tonne capacity-
investment  cost  (in  year-2007  dollars)  over  the  projection  period.  Some  projects 
announced in 2008 involve much higher costs, of over $80 per tonne, but over the 
Outlook period we expect real investment costs to moderate. These cost estimates 
have been applied in order to calculate the total investment required in new and 
replacement capacity over the  Outlook period to meet demand in the Reference 
Scenario. Investment of $1.20 per tonne produced (in year-2007 dollars) is added

in  order  to  provide  for  maintaining  existing  mines  during  their  economic  lives, 
to  replace  machinery  and  equipment,  and  to  access  new  reserves.  Increases  in 
port  capacity  and  shipping  investment  costs  have  also  been  taken  into  account.

In total, investment in the coal industry over 2007-2030 is now projected to amount 
to $728 billion (in year-2007 dollars). Some 91% of this is for mines, and the rest for 
ports and shipping (Figure 5.10). Investment in new capacity includes both surface 
and  underground  mine  development,  new  machinery  and  infrastructure.  Projected 
coal investment is 22% higher than in last year’s Outlook, reflecting the recent surge 
in costs as described above. China alone accounts for 44% of this investment. Despite 
these upwards revisions, coal investment accounts for only 3% of global energy-supply 
investment requirements.

POWER SECTOR OUTLOOK
World electricity demand in the Reference Scenario is projected to grow at an   z
annual rate of 3.2% in the period 2006 to 2015, slowing to 2% per year on average 
in  2015-2030.  This  reflects  a  shift  in  the  economies  of  non-OECD  countries 
away  from  energy-intensive  heavy  manufacturing  towards  lighter  industries 
and  services,  as  well  as  saturation  effects  in  the  OECD  and  some  emerging 
economies.
Most of the projected growth in electricity demand occurs outside the OECD. In   z
the OECD, electricity demand is projected to rise by just 1.1% per year on average, 
increasing by less than a third between 2006 and 2030. By contrast, demand in non-
OECD countries grows by 146%, at an average annual rate of 3.8%.
Globally,  coal  remains  the  main  fuel  for  power  generation  throughout  the   z
period to 2030. Its share in total generation increases from 41% to 44%. Most 
of the growth in coal-fired generation occurs in non-OECD countries, which are 
projected to generate over two-thirds of all coal-fired electricity, compared with 
less than half now. The overall efficiency of coal-fired generation is projected to 
increase from 34% in 2006 to 36% in 2015 and to 38% in 2030. Plants with carbon 
capture  and  storage  make  only  a  minor  contribution  to  generation  in  2030. 
Stronger policies would need to be put in place — especially a more generally 
applied  carbon  constraint  —  for  a  significant  amount  of  CCS  capacity  to  be 
commissioned before 2030.
The share of natural gas in the power-generation fuel mix falls, as a result of   z
higher prices. Nuclear power loses market share, dropping from 15% in 2006 to 
13% by 2015 and to 10% by 2030. The share of renewables rises considerably: it 
grows from 18% of total electricity generation in 2006 to 20% in 2015 and 23% by 
2030.
Total capacity additions — including replacement and expansion — amount to   z
about 4 530 GW over the Outlook period, of which about 1 690 GW is added in 
the period to 2015. These additions average around 190 GW per year through to 
2030 — about the same as over the past few years. Total cumulative investment 
in the power sector over the period 2007 to 2030 is projected at $13.6 trillion in 
year-2007 dollars, just over half of all energy-sector investment. 
The  cost  of  building  power  stations  has  increased  sharply  over  the  past  few   z
years, notably in OECD countries, because of increases in the cost of materials, 
high energy prices, rising labour costs and supply-chain constraints. Coal and gas 
prices are assumed to remain high. As a result, the electricity produced in new 
plants that come on line in the next few years is increasingly costly, pushing up 
end-user electricity prices.

Electricity demand
Global demand for electricity grew by nearly a quarter between 2000 and 2006, with 
nearly  three-quarters  of  the  increase  coming  from  non-OECD  countries  (Table  6.1). 1  
Demand in OECD countries increased by just 10% during that period, while the increase in 
non-OECD countries exceeded 50%. China alone saw a doubling of its electricity demand, 
contributing over 40% of the total increase worldwide. Overall, world electricity demand 
grew by 3.6% per year in the period 2000 to 2006, following closely the growth in gross 
domestic product. Electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of 3.2% in the 
period 2006 to 2015, slowing to 2% per year on average in the period 2015 to 2030. The 
projected slowdown in demand reflects a shift in the economies of non-OECD countries 
away from energy-intensive heavy manufacturing towards lighter industries and services, 
as well as efficiency improvements and saturation effects in the OECD and some emerging 
economies.

Chapter 6 - Power sector outlook
World demand for electricity grows from 15 665 TWh in 2006 to about 20 760 TWh in 
2015 and to about 28 140 TWh in 2030. The level in 2030 is lower than projected in last 
year’s WEO, mainly because of slower economic-growth expectations. Higher fossil-fuel 
prices in this year’s WEO also depress demand for electricity, as they lead to higher 
electricity prices. But this effect is partially offset by the improved competitiveness of 
electricity in end uses against direct use of fossil fuels for space and water heating, as 
electricity prices rise less rapidly in percentage terms. 
Non-OECD  countries  account  for  most  of  the  projected  growth  in  world  electricity 
demand. In the OECD, electricity demand is projected to rise by just 1.1% per year 
on average, increasing by around 30% between 2006 and 2030. By contrast, demand 
in non-OECD countries grows by 146% over the same period, averaging 3.8% per year. 
Demand grows fastest in Asia (Figure 6.1). China’s electricity demand has been growing 
at an average annual rate of 14% since 2000. This high rate is expected to slow over 
time. It drops to 7.6% per year in the period to 2015 and averages 4.6% per year over 
the entire Outlook period. The projected slowdown results primarily from a shift in the 
economic structure from heavy industry towards less energy-intensive lighter industry 
and services. Even at lower growth rates, China soon becomes the biggest electricity 
consumer in the world, leaving behind the United States and the European Union. 
In Russia, electricity demand is likely to grow at a rate slightly above that of the OECD; 
growth in demand there is driven by increased electrification in industry and rising 
household income, which boosts the use of appliances.

Globally, industrial demand for electricity grows faster than demand for electricity 
by households and the services sector, driven primarily by rapid industrialisation 
in  non-OECD  countries.  In  OECD  countries,  demand  for  electricity  in  industry 
grows  at  a  modest  0.6%  per  year,  reflecting  a  long-term  trend  toward  lighter 
manufacturing.

142 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Despite strong growth in electricity demand in non-OECD countries, a large number of 
people living there are not expected to have access to electricity even in 2030. India 
and Africa have the highest number of people in this category. 2  Per-capita electricity 
consumption in non-OECD countries doubles by 2030, rising to almost 2 400 kWh per 
person, but it is still well below the current OECD average of 7 641 kWh per person. 
There are large differences between countries: in China, per-capita electricity demand 
rises strongly, from 1 788 kWh in 2006 to 4 776 kWh by 2030, while in Africa, it rises 
modestly from 518 kWh now to 671 kWh (Figure 6.2).

Outlook for electricity generation
In the Reference Scenario, global electricity generation rises from 18 921 TWh in 2006 
to 24 975 TWh by 2015 and to 33 265 TWh by 2030. 3  The largest increase is in non-OECD 
countries where electricity generation in aggregate matches that of the OECD countries 
soon after 2010 and by 2030 is almost 50% higher. 
Coal remains the main fuel for power generation worldwide throughout the period to 
2030. On the back of strong growth in non-OECD countries, its share increases from 
41% to 44% (Figure 6.3). The share of natural gas in total generation falls slightly, as 
a result of higher prices. The share of oil drops to about 2% by 2030, as high oil prices 
make oil burning extremely expensive. Nuclear power, constrained by the assumption

of unchanged government policies, also loses market share, which drops from 15% in 
2006 to 13% by 2015 and further to 10% by 2030, as nuclear power capacity does not 
increase as rapidly as demand for electricity. Nuclear electricity generation increases 
from 2 793 TWh in 2006 to almost 3 460 TWh in 2030. The share of renewables rises 
considerably, from 18% in 2006 to 20% in 2015 and 23% in 2030.

Rest of renewables
Most electricity is projected to continue to come from centralised power stations, 
although there is a growing trend towards greater use of distributed generation: as 
increasing demand for reliable power supply and government policies to encourage 
the  use  of  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP)  and  renewable  energy  encourage  this 
solution. Good opportunities exist to provide heat and power for remote rural and 
urban communities. The use of CHP is projected to increase, based on biomass, natural 
gas  and  coal.  Generating  electricity  and  heat  simultaneously  offers  an  important 
opportunity to increase the overall efficiency of electricity and heat generation, and 
to reduce the environmental footprint. Providing for heat capture entails only a modest 
increase in investment costs and a slight loss of efficiency in electricity generation. 
Hence, CHP can be very profitable. The challenge is to match the heat supply with 
the demands of the industrial process. For district-heating systems, demand for heat 
can be spread across larger areas, but this requires substantial investment in heat-
distribution infrastructure.
Over 600 GW of power-generation capacity is currently under construction around the 
world, which is expected to be operational before 2015. Three-quarters of this new 
capacity is being built outside the OECD (Figure 6.4). About 200 GW is reported to 
be under construction in China, although this figure may be largely underestimated. 
These data provide useful insights into the future patterns of supply. Large amounts of 
coal-fired and hydropower capacity are set to come on line over the next few years. 
A smaller increase in nuclear power is in prospect. Gas-fired plants — combined-cycle 
gas turbines (CCGTs) and open-cycle turbines (OCTs) — which have short construction

times (two to three years for a CCGT and one to two years for an OCT) — and land-
based wind turbines, which have even shorter construction times (one to two years) 
may  change  the  picture  suggested  by  Figure 6.4  by  2015.  In  the  OECD,  there  is
more  gas-fired  capacity  under  construction  than  coal.  Most  of  this  is  being  built 
in Europe, because of tightening CO 2  regulations and because gas is valued for its 
flexibility.

Trends in coal-fired generation
Electricity  generation  from  coal-fired  power  plants  worldwide  reached  7  756  TWh 
in  2006,  over  40%  of  the  total.  In  recent  years,  most  of  the  growth  in  coal-fired 
generation has occurred in non-OECD countries, notably in China, where it more than 
doubled between 2000 and 2006. Since the beginning of market liberalisation in the 
1990s, most new capacity in OECD has been gas-fired, although a large amount of 
coal-fired capacity was added in the OECD Pacific region. New coal-fired plants with a 
capacity of 28 GW have come on line since 2000; 18 GW of this capacity was in OECD 
Pacific, 6 GW in OECD Europe and 4 GW in OECD North America. Sharp increases in gas 
prices have made the economics of new coal-fired power plants more favourable and 
many power companies have announced plans to build additional coal-fired capacity. 
Difficulties have arisen in many cases, however, in moving from the planning phase 
to construction and some projects have been abandoned, particularly in the United 
States  and  Europe,  because  of  local  opposition  driven  by  environmental  concerns. 
Some projects have also been abandoned because of rising construction costs and 
because of regulatory uncertainty about climate policies. A total of 31 GW is now 
under construction in OECD countries (Figure 6.5).

Globally, coal-based electricity is projected to rise to 11 100 TWh by 2015 and to 
almost  14  600  TWh  by  2030,  giving  rise  to  significant  increases  in  associated  CO 2  
emissions (see Chapter 16). Most of the growth takes place in non-OECD countries, 
which generate over two-thirds of all coal-fired electricity in 2030, compared with less 
than half now. Coal’s share of total electricity generation increases from 41% in 2006 to 
44% in 2015 and remains broadly at this level through to 2030. More than half of coal-
fired capacity now under construction is based on subcritical technology, while the 
remainder is mainly supercritical. Over the Outlook period, supercritical technology 
is expected to become the norm, first in the OECD. Ultrasupercritical technology is 
projected to become more widespread in the OECD after 2020. 
Integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) technology is expected to become more 
widespread after 2020. A small number of plants currently operating were initially 
built  with  public  funding  for  demonstration  purposes,  with  the  best  one  achieving 
42% electric efficiency (IEA, 2008a). There are plans to build IGCC plants in a number 
of  countries,  including  the  United  States,  the  United  Kingdom,  Australia,  Canada, 
Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Japan,  Poland,  Czech  Republic,  Indonesia,  India  and 
China, though not all of them are expected to go ahead. The United States has the 
largest number of projects but the announced construction costs are high. Under the 
assumption that construction costs fall, improving the economics of IGCC, a total of 
105 GW is projected to be built by 2030.
The average efficiency of coal-fired generation is projected to increase from 34% in 
2006 to 36% in 2015 and to 38% in 2030 (Figure 6.6). In the OECD, efficiency increases 
from 37% to 41%. Although electricity demand there does not increase much, there is a 
significant opportunity to improve efficiency as old coal-fired power plants are retired. 
In non-OECD countries, efficiency improves from 31% to 37% because new coal-fired 
power plants built to meet rapidly growing electricity demand are expected to be far 
more efficient than existing ones.

generation.  While  it  is  expected  to  continue  to  expand  in  the  future,  rising  to 
4 723 TWh in 2015 and to 6 404 TWh in 2030, growth will be constrained by high gas 
prices (see Chapter 1). Most of the growth is projected to occur in non-OECD countries, 
with  the  biggest  increase  in  the  Middle  East.  Gas-fired  generation  is  expected  to 
continue to grow in the OECD, although much more slowly than over the past decade. 
Although high natural gas prices are expected to constrain demand for new gas-fired 
generation, it still has advantages that make it attractive to investors, notably lower 
capital costs and a shorter construction time than most other technologies. Moreover, 
the operating flexibility of these plants makes them a very valuable component of the 
portfolio of a power company, while the usually high correlation between power and 
gas prices in liberalised markets reduces the extent of gas and power price risks. 
Gas-fired power plants are expected to be used increasingly for mid-merit order and 
peak load, replacing oil to some extent. This implies a need for a large increase in 
gas storage capacity. The projected large increase in power from variable renewable 
energy sources will require flexible back-up capacity: CCGTs and OCTs are expected to 
be used for this purpose, but high gas prices will make back-up power more expensive. 4  
Gas turbines are also expected to be used in decentralised electricity generation. Fuel 
cells using hydrogen from reformed natural gas are expected to emerge as a new source 
of distributed power after 2020, producing less than 1% of total electricity output in 
2030. 
4.  The need to combine variable renewables with gas also has implications for CO 2  emissions.

Trends in oil-fired generation
About  6%  of  total  electricity  generation  worldwide  is  based  on  oil  products.  This 
share has been declining slowly, due to high oil prices. In the OECD, the share of oil 
in total electricity generation was 4% in 2006; but it is much higher in a number of 
countries, notably in Mexico (22%), Greece (16%), Italy (15%), Japan (11%), Portugal 
(11%), Ireland (10%), Spain (8%) and South Korea (6%). In most other countries, it is 
less than 2%. The main oil product used for power generation in the OECD is fuel oil, 
which accounts for 64% of total oil-fired generation. In 2006, oil-fired generation in the 
OECD dropped sharply, by about 20%, in response to rising oil prices. In the long run, 
oil-fired generation in the OECD is projected to fall further, accounting for 1% of total 
generation by 2030. Use of heavy oil products is expected to fall particularly sharply, 
the main oil product still in use in 2030 being diesel oil, used for peaking and plant 
start up and in isolated areas. In non-OECD countries, oil-based electricity generation 
remains flat in absolute terms, representing a fall in oil’s share in total generation. 
As in the OECD, diesel oil is expected to become the main oil product. Oil-producing 
countries, notably in the Middle East, are projected to continue to reduce their reliance 
on oil, so that more can be available for export.  
Trends in nuclear power
World nuclear capacity reached 368 GW in 2006. This rose to 372 GW in 2007. About 
309 GW of this capacity was in OECD countries. Between 2000 and 2007, about 31 GW 
of new capacity were added worldwide. 5  In the OECD, new reactors started commercial 
operation in the Czech Republic, France, Japan, Slovakia and South Korea. Outside the 
OECD, new reactors were brought on line in Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, Romania, 
Russia and Ukraine. A total of 8 GW was shut down during the same period: in Bulgaria, 
Lithuania, Slovakia and Ukraine, following agreements with the European Union (4 GW); 
in the United Kingdom (16 reactors totalling 2 GW), Spain (the 141-MW Jose Cabrera 
reactor) and Russia (a 5-MW reactor) as plants reached the end of their operating lives; 
in Japan, the prototype 148-MW Fugen reactor, because of high operating costs; and in 
Sweden (a second reactor at the Barseback plant, following one that was shut down in 
1999) and Germany (two reactors with a total capacity of 980 MW) in implementation 
of policies to phase out nuclear power. 6
Over the past few years, a large number of countries have expressed renewed interest in 
building nuclear power plants, driven by concerns over energy security, surging fossil-fuel 
prices and rising CO 2  emissions. Few governments, however, have taken concrete steps 
to build new reactors, beyond those that have had active nuclear power construction 
programmes in place for a long time.
A total of 31 GW of nuclear capacity is now under construction in different parts of 
the world (Table 6.2). The construction of some of these reactors started a number of 
years ago and was subsequently halted, mainly for economic reasons. In Argentina, the

government recently decided to complete the construction of a second reactor at the 
Atucha nuclear power plant following energy shortages; construction originally started in 
1981 but had been put on hold. In Bulgaria, the government now plans to complete two 
reactors at the Belene plant, the construction of which had originally started in 1987. 
In Russia, work has been restarted on three of the seven reactors under construction in 
the 1980s. In Ukraine, there are plans to complete two unfinished reactors, construction 
of which started in the mid 1980s. In the United States, the Tennessee Valley Authority 
plans to complete a second reactor at the Watts Bar plant, on which construction started 
in 1972. In Iran, one reactor at the Bushehr power plant, which had been abandoned in 
the 1970s, is now almost complete. In total, these reactors account for a third of the 
total nuclear capacity under construction.

Most  of  the  nuclear  capacity  now  under  construction  is  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region. 
China has the largest amount of capacity under construction in the world. India, Japan 
and South Korea are planning significant increases in their nuclear power capacity. 
World nuclear capacity is projected to rise to 397 GW by 2015 and to 433 GW by 2030. 
Installed capacity in 2030 is 18 GW higher than projected in WEO-2007 because the 
nuclear gain from assumed higher fossil-fuel prices offsets the effect of lower global 
demand for electricity. Most of the increase is in Asia, where China, India, Japan and 
South  Korea  are  projected  to  nearly  double  their  installed  nuclear  capacity,  from 
75 GW to 142 GW. Prospects for nuclear power have also picked up in the United 
States. Since 2002, a number of policies have been put in place to address investor 
concerns and some 17 companies and consortia are actively pursuing licenses for more

than 30 nuclear power plants. In the Reference Scenario, installed nuclear capacity in 
the United States increases from 100 GW to 115 GW. In the European Union, nuclear 
capacity drops from 131 GW in 2006 to 89 GW in 2030, mainly as a result of phase-out 
policies in Germany, Belgium and Sweden.
Trends in renewable energy
Higher  fossil-fuel  prices  and  increasing  concerns  over  energy  security  and  climate 
change are expected to encourage the development of renewable energy for electricity 
production in many parts of the world, particularly where incentives are already in 
place.  Electricity  generated  from  renewable  energy  sources  worldwide  amounted 
to 3 470 TWh in 2006, or 18% of total output. In the Reference Scenario, it rises to 
4 970 TWh in 2015 and to over 7 700 TWh in 2030, 23% of total electricity production. 
Trends in renewable energy are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Trends in CO 2  capture and storage
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology for carbon abatement, 
even though it has not yet been applied to large-scale power generation. Widespread 
deployment  of  CCS  depends  on  developments  in  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks, 
financing mechanisms, international co-operation, technological advances and public 
awareness.  Recommendations  on  how  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of  CCS  were 
developed  in  2007  under  a  joint  International  Energy  Agency-Carbon  Sequestration 
Leadership  Forum  (IEA-CSLF)  initiative,  involving  wide  consultation  with  interested 
parties. These recommendations include launching 20 full-scale CCS projects by 2010 
and making CCS eligible for funds from the Clean Development Mechanism (IEA-CSLF, 
2007). Market mechanisms alone will not be sufficient to achieve the demonstration 
programme on the scale required. Another challenge is financing the necessary CO 2  
transport infrastructure. 
Recent legal and regulatory developments include amendments to the London Protocol 
and the OSPAR (Oslo-Paris) Convention to allow for storage of CO 2  in formations below 
the international waters that are covered by those treaties. The European Commission’s  
climate change and renewable energy package, released in January 2008, includes a 
new directive on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which addresses CCS among 
other matters. It proposes new legislation to encourage CO 2  storage.  Also, under the 
European Union’s Zero Emissions Technology Platform, the FLAGSHIP programme will 
provide guidance on criteria for selecting 10 to 12 demonstration projects covering all 
the technology blocks of CCS (power plant and capture, and CO 2  transport and storage) 
for evaluation by the European Commission. 7
In 2008, the StatoilHydro Snohvit project started injecting CO 2  into a 2 600-metre deep 
formation, becoming the world’s fourth large-scale CCS project. In November 2007, 
the United Kingdom announced a national competition for government co-funding of a 
7.  The Zero Emissions Technology Platform is a joint initiative between European industry, scientists and 
NGOs with support from the European Union to accelerate the development of low-carbon power-generation 
technologies and, in particular, CCS.

In  the  Reference  Scenario,  CCS  makes  only  a  minor  contribution.  Stronger  policies 
will need to be put in place — especially a widely applicable carbon constraint — if a 
significant amount of CCS capacity is to be commissioned before 2030 (see Part C).
New capacity and investment needs in infrastructure
Total  installed  power-generation  capacity  worldwide  in  the  Reference  Scenario  is 
projected to rise from 4 344 GW in 2006 to 5 697 GW in 2015 and to 7 484 GW in 2030. 
Total gross capacity additions amount to 4 528 GW over the period, with 1 691 GW 
installed by 2015. 8  This is an average of 190 GW of new capacity per year through to 
2030 — about the same as over the past few years.
Cumulative  global  power-sector  investment  over  2007-2030,  including  generation, 
transmission and distribution, is $13.6 trillion (in year-2007 dollars), just over half of all 
energy-sector investment. Some $6.8 trillion of investment is required in generation, 
while transmission and distribution networks together need $6.8 trillion, of which two-
thirds goes to distribution. The largest investment requirements, exceeding $3 trillion, 
arise in China. Investment needs are also very large in OECD North America and Europe. 
Table 6.4 summarises the capacity additions and investment needs by region over the 
Outlook period.

Electricity generating costs 
Trends in construction costs
There have recently been sharp increases in construction costs of new power plants, 
particularly in OECD countries. For non-OECD countries, fewer cost data are available, 
making it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the extent of the increases experienced 
there. The sharpest increases have been in the United States, where the construction 
cost of a new supercritical coal plant has doubled over a few years. Companies planning 
to build nuclear power plants there have announced construction costs at least 50% 
higher than previously expected. Similar trends, although somewhat less pronounced, 
are evident in other OECD countries. Table 6.5 provides an overview of these trends as 
seen by a power plant manufacturer. The main causes of higher costs are as follows:
Increases in the cost of materials:    The prices of metals typically used in power 
plants (iron, steel, aluminium, copper) have substantially increased since 2003/2004 
(Figure 6.7) and the prices of some special steels used in power plant manufacturing 
have increased even faster than the average steel price shown in the chart. Cement 
prices  are  also  reported  to  have  gone  up.  These  material  costs  have  increased 
primarily because of high global demand for commodities and manufactured goods, 
higher production and transportation costs (in part owing to high fuel prices), and a 
weakening US dollar (The Brattle Group, 2007).

Increase  in  energy  costs:     High  energy  prices  affect  the  manufacturing  and

Increase  in  demand:     As  their  reserve  margins  are  shrinking,  OECD  countries  are 
entering a new investment cycle. Outside the OECD, strong growth in electricity 
demand is pushing up orders for new plant.
Tight manufacturing capacity:    Reportedly, manufacturers of power plants are often 
not able to fulfil orders quickly because of a lack of capacity and a shortage of

skilled engineers. Steam boilers, gas turbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic panels 
are all in short supply. Many manufacturers claim that their order books are full for 
the next three to five years. At present, the nuclear industry faces bottlenecks in 
the construction of large steel forgings (an essential component of reactors). 
Increases in labour costs:    A shortage of engineering, procurement and construction 
contractors  in  some  regions  and  rising  labour  costs,  particularly  in  non-OECD 
countries, is pushing up total project costs.

Cost and efficiency assumptions
The  power-plant  construction-cost  assumptions  used  in  this  Outlook  have  been 
substantially revised upwards (following a revision in WEO-2006) to take account of 
recent trends and industry expectations. 9  Because the uncertainties surrounding future 
construction costs are so large, our newly revised costs for most types of power plants 
are generally assumed to apply from the onset and remain constant through to 2030. 
There are, however, some qualifications to this. Some cost reductions are assumed 
for  new  technologies,  notably  for  IGCC  and  renewables.  The  construction  costs  of 
coal-fired power plants in China now are several times lower than in OECD countries. 
They  are  assumed  to  increase  over  time,  reflecting  increases  in  labour  costs  and 
more stringent environmental requirements, though they remain substantially lower 
than in the OECD even in 2030. China’s emergence as a major supplier of coal-fired

power plants to the rest of Asia and markets further afield (such as Russia and Africa) 
competing with well-established manufacturers in international markets, could drive 
down construction costs for all regions.
Fossil-fuel prices have soared in recent years and are assumed to remain high. Higher 
plant construction and fuel-input costs result in much higher levelised generation costs 
over the projection period than in past WEOs. The electricity produced in new plants 
expected to come on line in the next few years will cost much more in OECD countries 
than was projected in WEO-2006, driving up end-use electricity prices. Generating costs 
in non-OECD countries are also much higher, but how much final prices are affected 
will depend on what subsidy-reform policies their governments adopt. 
As illustrated in Figure 6.8, by comparison with coal, nuclear or wind generation, gas-
fired generation is by far the most expensive in 2015 and 2030 in the United States, the 
European Union, China and India on the assumption of continuity of present policies. 10

In the European Union, an assumed carbon value of $30 per tonne of CO 2  adds around 
$30 per MWh to the generating cost of coal-fired plant and around $15 per MWh to 
the cost of power from CCGT plants. 11  As a result, the difference in total cost between 
the two types of generation is small. Coal is the cheapest way to generate electricity
10.  Wholesale power prices in European and North American markets are already in the same order of ma-
gnitude as the costs calculated here.
11. A value of $30 per tonne CO 2  is assumed for ETS over the Outlook period. This is equal to €22 per tonne 
CO 2 , assuming an exchange rate of 0.73 euros per dollar (average value in 2007).

in the absence of a carbon value. In the United States, coal is accordingly the cheapest 
way  to  produce  electricity,  followed  by  wind  power.  Nuclear  power  in  the  United 
States is more expensive than coal and wind, but expectations about carbon constraints 
and a large need for firm base-load power are expected to support the development 
of new nuclear power stations. In China, coal is by far the cheapest way to produce 
electricity because of low construction costs and cheap fuel. Coal is also the cheapest 
way to generate electricity in India (as in many other non-OECD countries), though it 
is more expensive than in China. 12  Generally, gas-fired generation becomes even more 
expensive over time. Coal-based generating costs fall slightly between 2015 and 2030 
because coal prices are assumed to go down after 2015.
What are the risks of investing in the power sector?
Projected generating costs (Figure 6.8) are but one criterion used by investors 
to decide on whether to invest and on the type of technology. Power companies 
increasingly  use  portfolio  investment-valuation  methodologies  to  take  into 
account  risks  over  their  entire  plant  portfolio,  rather  than  focussing  on  the 
technology  with  the  lowest  stand-alone  projected  generating  cost.  Investors 
may  accept  different  risk  profiles  for  different  technologies,  depending  on 
project-specific circumstances. 
Concern about both climate change and structural change in the industry have 
introduced new risks for electricity operators. In relation to climate change, the 
risk is of uncertainty as to future policy and its implementation. The structural 
risk is more fundamental, since it involves the transfer of risk from the consumer 
(or tax payer) to the investor. In the traditional, vertically integrated public 
service model, the supply company was often a monopoly and could count on 
recovering the investment and the target return (in practice, governments often 
imposed price controls, for political reasons).
In the competitive situation now existing in most OECD countries and several 
non-OECD countries, risks have, to some extent, moved from rate and tax payers 
to competing market players. This perception of increased risk drives up the 
investor’s required rate of return, a factor influencing the cost assumptions now 
embedded in the calculations from which our projections derive.

Electricity prices 
Electricity  prices  paid  by  final  customers  have  increased  in  real  terms  in  many 
OECD countries since the beginning of this decade, after falling during the 1990s 
(Figure 6.9). Sharply higher fuel-input costs, which make up a significant share of 
the total cost of power supplied to end users, are the principal reason, especially 
since 2003. The impact of fuel price increases on electricity prices is most direct for 
gas, which accounts for the largest part of the total costs of generating electricity. 
Moreover, electricity prices are set by marginal generation costs and — in more and 
more markets and on more and more occasions — CCGTs are the marginal generation 
source. Coal and uranium costs have also increased markedly, though in the case 
of  uranium  the  cost  of  the  fuel  accounts  for  only  about  5%  of  the  total  cost  of 
generation.

In the European Union, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has also contributed to 
higher electricity prices (Figure 6.10). The price of carbon on the ETS fell sharply in 
2006 as it became clear that CO 2  allowances were plentiful for the first phase of the 
scheme, which ran until end-2007. This price drop was reflected in a marked fall in 
wholesale electricity prices in several European markets, illustrating the emerging 
tight interaction between the ETS and wholesale electricity trade. Wholesale prices 
rebounded in 2007 and 2008 with higher prices for carbon under the second phase of 
the scheme.
Over the projection period, electricity prices are expected to increase, reflecting fuel 
price increases and higher construction costs. On average, OECD electricity prices are 
projected to be 11% higher in 2030 than in 2006.

Chapter 7 - Renewable energy outlook 159
CHAPTER 7
H I G H L I G H T S
RENEWABLE ENERGY OUTLOOK
Renewable  energy  sources  are  set  to  expand  rapidly.  Excluding  traditional   z
biomass use, their share of global primary energy demand is projected to climb 
from 7% in 2006 to 10% by 2030 in the Reference Scenario. This results from 
lower costs as renewable technologies mature, assumed higher fossil-fuel prices, 
which make renewables relatively more competitive, and strong policy support. 
The  renewables  industry  has  the  opportunity  to  exploit  this  development  to 
eliminate its reliance on subsidies and to bring emerging technologies into the 
mainstream.
World renewables-based electricity generation — mostly hydro and wind power   z
— is projected to more than double over the Outlook period, its share of total 
electricity output rising from 18% in 2006 to 23% in 2030. Renewables overtake gas 
to become the second-largest source of electricity, behind coal, before 2015.
In the OECD, the total projected increase in renewable electricity generation   z
is  bigger  than  the  combined  increase  in  fossil  fuel-based  and  nuclear  power 
generation. The share of renewables in electricity generation increases by ten 
percentage points to 26% over the Outlook period.
Global output of wind power is projected to increase eleven-fold, becoming the   z
second-largest source of renewable electricity after hydro by 2010. The largest 
increase is in the European Union, where the share of wind power reaches 14% 
in 2030, accounting for 60% of the increase in total EU electricity generation 
between 2006 and 2030.
Biomass,  geothermal  and  solar  thermal  provided  around  6%  of  total  global   z
heating demand in 2006. This share is projected to increase to 7% in 2030. Where 
resources are abundant and conventional energy sources expensive, renewables-
based heating can be very cost competitive with conventional fossil-fuel heating 
systems. 
The share of biofuels in the total supply of road transport fuels worldwide is   z
projected to rise from 1.5% in 2006 to 5% in 2030, spurred by subsidies and high 
oil prices. Most of the growth comes from the United States, Europe, China and 
Brazil. Second-generation biofuels are expected to become commercially viable 
but still make only a small contribution to total biofuels supply towards the end 
of the projection period.
Total cumulative investment in renewable energy supply in 2007-2030 amounts   z
to  $5.5  trillion  (in  year  2007  dollars).  The  greater  part  of  this  investment  is 
for electricity generation. Renewables account for just under half of the total 
projected investment in electricity generation.
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Global trends in the use of renewable energy
The use of renewable energy sources has been expanding rapidly in recent years and this 
trend is set to continue over the projection period. Investment in renewable energy sources 
for electricity, heating and in biofuels has increased considerably. However, if traditional 
biomass is excluded, 1  renewable energy still accounts for a small share of the energy mix. 
In 2006 it met just 7% of global primary energy needs. The share was around 6% for heat 
demand (mostly from the direct combustion of biomass) and 1% for transport (biofuels 
derived from biomass). Renewables accounted for 18% of total electricity generation, the 
majority of it coming from hydropower plants (16% of total electricity generation). In the 
Reference Scenario, the share of renewables (including modern biomass) in the global 
primary energy mix increases from 7% in 2006 to around 10% in 2030.
In the electricity sector, the generating costs of coal- and gas-fired power plants remain 
high, because of both high fuel prices and high construction costs. 2  Over the projection 
period, oil, gas and coal prices are assumed to remain high by historical standards (see 
Chapter 1). While the construction costs of some renewables have also increased recently, 
the costs of renewable energy systems are expected to fall in the coming decades, mainly 
as a result of advances in technology and declining capital costs as their use expands. 
Demand for renewables for heating and cooling, and demand for biofuels are also expected 
to be boosted by high fossil-fuel prices. There is a good opportunity during the next decade 
or so for the renewables industry to prove it can become cost competitive without relying 
on subsidies and for the technologies to enter the mainstream. A carbon price on fossil fuels 
would make renewables even more competitive (see Part C).
Despite the improved environment for emerging renewables sources and technologies, 
many barriers to their deployment remain. These could hold back long-term growth of 
the sector. They include: the relatively high costs of some technologies in the absence of 
subsidies; relatively limited research and development until recently; growing concerns 
about the impact on food availability of the use of crops for energy; a lack of skilled labour 
and policymaking capacity; regulations that discourage variable and distributed power- 
generating systems; inadequate investment in networks; and scepticism on the part of 
some major incumbent players in the energy sector about the viability of renewables.
Biomass  (including  traditional  biomass)  is  expected  to  remain  by  far  the  single  most 
important primary source of renewable energy for decades to come. In the Reference 
Scenario, total world demand for biomass rises from 1 186 Mtoe in 2006 to about 1 660 Mtoe 
by 2030, although its share of world primary energy demand falls slightly from 10.1% in 2006 
to 9.8% in 2030. Biomass differs from other renewable energy resources in that it can be a 
substitute for all fossil-fuel based products, using a wide range of technologies to convert 
the range of resources into heat, electricity and liquid fuels (Figure 7.1). It can be used 
directly in traditional ways for heating and cooking, or indirectly using modern conversion 
technologies. An estimated 60% of current biomass use is in the form of traditional biomass 
such as scavenged fuelwood, dried animal dung and agricultural residues used on open fires 
and in crude, low-efficiency stoves to provide basic cooking and heating services.

Chapter 7 - Renewable energy outlook
The  quality  of  data  on  biomass  use  is  often  very  poor,  making  future  projections 
uncertain.  Major  uncertainties  in  projecting  future  demand  for  biomass  for  energy 
purposes include competition for land use (Box 7.1), the rate of improvement in crop 
yields, water availability for crop production, the effects of climate change and the 
development  of  advanced  conversion  technologies.  Most  of  the  biomass  consumed 
in 2030 still comes from agricultural and forest residues, but a growing share comes 
from purpose-grown energy crops — mainly for making biofuels. A growing share is also 
projected to fuel combined heat and power (CHP) plants.

Box 7.1 z  Land use required to grow biomass for energy
Of the 13.2 billion hectares (Gha) of the world total land area, more than 10% (1.5 Gha) 
are currently used to produce arable crops and over a quarter (3.5 Gha) are in pasture 
for meat, milk and wool production from grazing animals. Annually, around 7 to 8 Mha 
of forest land is converted to agriculture. Crops grown specifically for biofuels currently 
utilise around 1% of total agricultural land (FAO, 2008; WWI, 2007). This 1% share is the 
same in Brazil, where over 40% of the total gasoline demand is provided by ethanol based 
on sugarcane for feedstock and more is exported. At 38%, however, the land in Brazil, 
of which only a quarter is currently cultivated, is much higher than the world average 
of 10%. Other countries in Latin America and Africa also have the potential to expand 
their agricultural production with the aid of modern farm-management techniques and 
improved crop varieties, without resorting to deforestation. Shortage of water, either 
as natural rainfall or irrigation, can be a major constraint on increased energy crop 
production in some regions. Globally, some of the 1 Gha of marginal and degraded lands 
unsuitable for food production (due to rising salinity levels, for example, in Australia) 
could be reclaimed for productive use by growing selected energy crops.

Renewables for electricity 
Renewables-based electricity generation is expected to grow substantially over the 
coming decades, benefiting from high fossil-fuel prices, declining investment costs 
and  government  support.  In  the  Reference  Scenario,  world  renewable  electricity 
generation is projected to increase from 3 470 TWh in 2006 to 4 970 TWh in 2015 
and to 7 705 TWh in 2030. Before 2015, electricity from renewable energy sources is 
projected to overtake gas as the world’s second-largest source of electricity behind 
coal, rising from 18% in 2006 to 20% in 2015 and 23% in 2030 (Figure 7.2). The increase 
is far more substantial in OECD countries, where the share of renewables in electricity 
generation increases by ten percentage points, to 26%, over the Outlook period.

Hydropower remains the leading renewable source of electricity worldwide (Figure 7.3). 
But despite the projected large increase for hydropower in absolute terms — it nearly 
doubles in non-OECD between 2006 and 2030 — its share of total electricity generation 
falls over the projection period, even in non-OECD countries. The use of other renewables 
in electricity generation in non-OECD countries increases faster than hydropower. The 
share of all renewables in electricity generation in non-OECD countries increases from 
21% in 2006 to 22% in 2030.
In the period to 2015, most of the increase in renewables generation is expected to 
come from hydro and onshore wind power. Both continue to grow between 2015 and 
2030. Biomass and offshore wind power also grow briskly during this period. Solar power 
(both photovoltaics and concentrating solar) see their share of electricity output grow 
in many countries. In the OECD, the total projected increase in renewable electricity 
generation is bigger than the combined increase in fossil fuel-based and nuclear power 
generation (Figure 7.4).

The  costs  of  power  generation  from  renewables  are  expected  to  fall  over  time
(Figure 7.5).  The  main  reason  is  increased  deployment,  which  accelerates 
technological  progress  and  increases  economies  of  scale  in  manufacturing  the 
associated equipment, resulting in lower investment costs (Figure 7.6). The costs 
of the more mature technologies, including geothermal and onshore wind power, 
are assumed to fall the least. The investment costs of hydropower remain broadly 
unchanged.
In reality, there is a wide range of generation costs for each technology, based mainly 
on the assumed lifetime, proximity to demand and local resource availability. Wind

164 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
power onshore, for example, can be generated for $30 to $40 per MWh in New Zealand, 
where many good sites near to cities enjoy a high mean annual wind speed, above
10 m/s. This enables wind to compete with hydro and gas without subsidies. Typical 
sites in Denmark and Germany, however, have mean wind speeds closer to 7 m/s, 
so that the same wind turbine generates only around half the electricity output per 
year that it would if built in New Zealand. The resulting relatively high generating 
costs require supporting policies to enable wind power to compete. In addition, since 
the generation costs of renewable electricity, other than from biomass, are largely 
dependent on the investment cost, the choice of discount rate applied adds to the 
wide cost range.
The  different  characteristics  of  the  output  from  different  renewable  energy 
technologies must also be taken into account when comparing renewable generating 
costs and when comparing them with fossil fuels and nuclear. 3  The service provided 
by large hydro, notably when storage is used, makes it competitive with traditional 
peak-load  and  mid-load  plants,  which  have  higher  generating  costs  than  base-load 
plants. This increases the value of hydropower. By contrast, supply from wind and solar 
power depends on the availability of wind and sun. The output from these resources 
is variable, but if it correlates with peak load (for example, solar energy is available 
at peak hours in California, Japan and Southern Europe) the value of the electricity 
produced is higher.

Hydropower
After two decades of stagnation, hydropower is making a comeback. Some 170 GW of 
hydropower capacity is under construction worldwide implying a significant increase 
of generation over the next decade (Figure 7.7).  Most of this capacity is being built in 
non-OECD Asian countries such as China, India and Vietnam. The remaining potential 
in non-OECD countries is still large. Several non-OECD countries are re-focusing on this 
domestic source of electricity, driven by rapidly expanding power demand, the high 
cost of fossil fuels, growing concerns about pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions, and 
the perceived benefits to supply security by diversifying the electricity-generation mix. 
In Latin America, however, the amount of capacity under construction falls far short 
of that sought by government, notably in Brazil. Only 5 GW are being built, whereas 
the government expects installed capacity of 76 GW to double by 2030 (MME, 2007). 
We project hydropower capacity in Brazil to reach 104 GW in 2030 in the Reference 
Scenario.
Interest and support for hydropower projects in non-OECD countries are growing among 
international  lenders  and  the  private  sector.  In  the  OECD,  many  of  the  best  sites 
have already been exploited and environmental regulations severely constrain new 
development. Most of the projected increase there comes from large-scale projects 
in  Turkey  and  Canada.  Several  other  OECD  countries  are  providing  incentives  for 
developing small and mini-hydropower projects.
Hydropower  generation  is  projected  to  increase  from  3  035  TWh  in  2006  to  over 
3 730 TWh by 2015 and 4 810 TWh by 2030. Nevertheless, the share of hydropower 
in total electricity generation continues its downward trend, falling from 16% now to 
15% in 2015 and 14.5% in 2030 as other power-generation technologies grow at faster 
rates.

Wind power
Wind power has been growing at around 25% per year over the past few years. Worldwide, 
installed wind power capacity rose from about 6 GW in 1996 to 74 GW in 2006 and to 
94 GW in 2007, with over 60% installed in OECD Europe. Germany has the largest installed 
capacity in the world, reaching 20.6 GW in 2006 and over 22 GW in 2007. Germany and 
Spain together account for about two-thirds of installed wind power capacity in OECD 
Europe. The rapid growth of wind power in these two countries is largely due to feed-in 
tariff systems, 4  which offer high buy-back rates and guarantee a market for the output 
from wind farms. Globally, wind power accounts for a very small share of total electricity 
generation (around 0.7%), but this share is much higher in some countries (Table 7.1).

4. A feed-in tariff is the price per unit of electricity that a power company has to pay for the purchase of renewa-
ble electricity which it is obliged by law to take from private generators. The tariff rate is ﬁ xed by the govern-
ment, usually at a level high enough to encourage investment in electricity generation from renewables.

The United States has recently emerged as a major growth area for wind power 
and  became  the  world’s  second-largest  market  in  2007.  Although  incentives 
have been in place for a long time (a federal production tax credit [PTC] was 
introduced in 1992), very little growth in wind power was seen until recently. 
Instability of policy led to the PTC expiring, being extended, then later being 
renewed  several  times,  heightening  uncertainty  and  risks  for  investors.  The 
current PTC is again due to expire at the end of 2008, after a one-year extension. 
The projections in this Outlook assume that the PTC will continue to be renewed, 
as it has been in the past. More recently, state-level incentives and obligations, 
and rising fossil-fuel prices have encouraged growth in wind power. Most of the 
growth has been in Texas and California, but wind power is also expected to grow 
in other states in the future. In the past, many projects in the United States faced 
siting difficulties, which resulted in them either not obtaining a licence or in very 
high costs, which made the developers abandon the project. Uncertainties remain 
about  how  fast  the  overall  system  and  transmission  network  will  be  upgraded 
to  accommodate  large  volumes  of  wind  power.  At  the  moment,  not  enough 
investment is going into the grid, which is impairing reliability. We assume that 
some of these difficulties will be overcome in the near future, facilitating the 
development of wind power.
Outside the OECD, India and China are important growing markets for wind power. 
India now has the fourth-largest installed capacity in the world and the largest 
outside the OECD. Wind power is also growing fast in China, where capacity has 
increased considerably since 2005. Both countries boast flourishing wind-turbine 
manufacturing industries.
Global wind power output is projected to increase from 130 TWh in 2006 to more 
than 660 TWh in 2015 and 1 490 TWh in 2030. This increase will make wind the 
second-largest source of renewable electricity, after hydro, by 2010. Its share in 
total electricity generation rises from less than 1% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2015 and 4.5% 
in 2030. The share varies significantly between regions. In the European Union, 
it  reaches  14%  in  2030,  accounting  for  60%  of  the  increase  in  total  electricity 
generation between 2006 and 2030. In the United States, the share of wind rises 
ten-fold to 6.2% by 2030, meeting almost 30% of incremental demand for electricity 
between 2006 and 2030. 
Offshore turbines account for only a very small share of total wind-power capacity 
today,  but  this  share  is  expected  to  increase  substantially  by  2030  as  costs 
decline.  Globally,  offshore  wind  power  production  reaches  about  350  TWh  in 
2030, up from only 3 TWh at present. The most substantial increase occurs in the 
European Union, where 27% of wind power could come from offshore installations 
by 2030.
Grid integration of wind power and other variable renewables
The rising share of wind power in electricity generation is posing a challenge for power 
companies  in  integrating  this  capacity  into  the  network  where  penetration  levels 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
168 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
are high. Wind power, like electrical power from wave, ocean currents, run-of-river 
hydro, solar photovoltaics and concentrating solar power systems, is different from 
conventional  generating  capacity  because  of  its  variability.  These  power  outputs 
fluctuate  according  to  the  prevailing  conditions  of  weather,  season  and  time  of 
day. There are, therefore, additional costs associated with the integration of these 
technologies into the power-supply system, including those associated with necessary 
back-up capacity and operation, 5  and grid access (IEA 2008a). 6  These extra costs can 
add up to $13 per MWh to the generating cost of wind power.
Potential  problems  due  to  variability  affecting  the  reliability  of  an  electricity-
supply  system  are  manageable  when  the  shares  of  wind  and  other  variable 
renewables-based power capacity are small, but they become more pronounced 
as the shares rise. Technical problems can be largely overcome if the system is 
sufficiently flexible in responding quickly to large fluctuations in both supply and/
or demand. This can be the case if the system includes a balanced portfolio of 
power-generation  technologies  and  fuels,  substantial  hydropower  capacity  with 
dam  or  pumped  storage,  arrangements  for  load-shedding  to  offset  both  peak 
demands and periods of lower power supply from variable renewables, good inter-
connection between neighbouring systems to reduce balancing requirements, and 
energy  storage  facilities  (Box  7.2).  Nonetheless,  in  a  liberalised  power  market, 
higher shares of variable renewables, perhaps above 10% to 15% of total generation, 
may need some form of government regulation which mandates the integration of 
a specified share of renewables into the system.
Solar photovoltaics
Worldwide, electricity generation from solar photovoltaics (PV) is still tiny, though 
the potential is very large. Installed global photovoltaics capacity was around 6 GW in 
2006, with most of it installed in Germany (2.9 GW), Japan (1.7 GW) and the United 
States (0.6 GW).  
Electricity generation from PV integrated into buildings is, of course, more econo-
mically  attractive  in  areas  with  abundant  sunshine  and  high  electricity  prices.  PV 
power is particularly valuable when maximum PV generation — around the middle of a 
sunny day — coincides with peak electricity demand (such as for air-conditioning). PV is 
already a cost-effective option in remote off-grid applications, either as a stand-alone 
system or as a part of a mini-grid. 
PV technology has the highest investment cost of all commercially deployed renewable 
energy  sources.  Investment  costs  for  a  system  (including  solar  collection  modules 
and  the  other  components  of  the  plant),  currently  range  from  around  $5  500  to 
5. Alternative generating capacity must be available to meet demand when there is no wind. Due to the 
current difﬁ culty of accurately predicting wind patterns more than 36 hours in advance as required by some 
transmission operators, the provision of a reliable supply of power within a system can be complex and 
costly. Where gate-closure times are only 1 to 2 hours, the problem is largely overcome.
6.  Wind turbines can be connected to the local grid at low-voltage levels, a practice that may save grid 
losses but adds to the complexity of system control and operation.

$9 000 per kW, depending on the type of solar cell, scale of installation and local labour 
costs. In spite of big falls in module costs in recent years and increases in the efficiency 
of commercial cells, PV generation remains relatively costly. Further technological 
advances  and  ultimately  achieving  economies  of  scale  will  depend  on  government 
subsidies. However, new semi-automated PV manufacturing plants, with high annual 
production capacities of around 300 MW, are bringing down module costs per unit.
In the Reference Scenario, the investment cost of a PV system is projected to fall to
$2 600 per kW by 2030. There is optimism in the photovoltaics industry that very large
cost reductions are in prospect, well before 2030.
Box 7.2 z  Energy storage
Where  variable-output  renewable  energy  systems,  such  as  wind  and  solar, 
account for a major part of power generation within a system, storing surplus 
energy  to  meet  later  demand  is  one  way  to  reduce  the  need  for  back-up 
generating capacity: storage avoids the need for power to be generated instantly 
to meet demand. Currently, storage is rarely the cheapest way of dealing with 
variability, but it could become increasingly viable as the price of carbon rises.
Electricity cannot be stored directly (except in small capacitors), so it needs to 
be converted into other forms of storable energy, such as chemical energy in 
batteries, the potential (gravitational) energy of water in pumped-hydro storage 
systems,  or  mechanical  energy  as  compressed  air  or  in  flywheels.  Advanced 
systems  are  under  development,  such  as  ultra-capacitors,  superconducting 
magnetic  systems  and  vanadium  redox  batteries,  but  they  tend  to  have  low 
energy densities and poor durability, and add high costs to the system.
The capacities of storage systems, the cost of their construction and the overall 
costs per unit of energy stored vary widely. The capacity of facilities for pumped 
hydropower and compressed air in underground cavities can reach hundreds of 
MW. The re-conversion efficiency of pumped storage can be higher than 70%. 
Flywheels can be more efficient, but generally only at a very small scale. Batteries 
used either individually or in banks are around 70% efficient with capacities of 
just a few MW at the most. They tend to be more costly than the other options, at 
around $20 per MWh. The other key variable of a storage technology is the energy 
discharge time, which can range from seconds to hours.
Producing  hydrogen  as  an  energy  carrier  from  renewable  electricity  systems 
— by electrolysis, thermo-chemically from biomass, or by other means — can 
be another form of storage. This can be at a large scale in aquifers or caverns, 
or  on  a  small  scale  involving  compressing  and  storing  the  gas  in  cylinders  or 
transmission pipes. The hydrogen can be used to generate electricity in fuel cells 
on demand but the overall efficiency of the system tends to be low, at around 
40%. As a result of this and the high current investment costs for fuel cells, the 
unit cost is high.

170 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Electricity generation from photovoltaics in the Reference Scenario is projected 
to reach 42 TWh in 2015 and 245 TWh in 2030, up from just a few TWh in 2006. 
Most of the increase comes from decentralised systems integrated into buildings 
where the generation cost competes against the retail electricity price and not 
the lower wholesale market price. Generous feed-in tariffs and other government 
incentives, together with falling PV costs and rising grid electricity prices, drive 
this growth. 
Concentrating solar thermal power
Several  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP)  options  are  currently  available  for  large-
scale  electricity  generation,  though  they  are  at  varying  stages  of  development. 
The  parabolic-trough  is  already  commercially  available,  while  the  parabolic-dish 
and central-receiver technologies are still at the demonstration stage. These could 
eventually  achieve  higher  conversion  efficiencies  and  lower  capital  costs  than  the 
parabolic-trough technology. 
Today’s oldest commercial parabolic-trough projects were developed in the United 
States in the early 1980s. CSP installation has been very slow since then, due to 
the high capital cost of the system. However, following a few parabolic-dish and 
central-receiver  demonstration  projects  in  Australia,  Greece,  Israel,  Spain  and 
Switzerland, as well as in the United States, interest in CSP has started to rise again. 
Total installed capacity of CSP was 354 MW in 2006. In 2007, a new 64 MW plant came 
on line in the United States and a 50 MW plant in Spain. Another 255 MW is under 
construction  in  Italy  and  Spain.  Several  new  projects  are  being  planned  in  other 
countries, including China, Iran, Jordan and Malta, with over 2 GW of total installed 
capacity likely by 2010.
CSP generation is projected to reach 11 TWh by 2015 and 107 TWh by 2030. Current 
power-generating costs under the best conditions are around $150 to $250 per MWh or 
even less where the sun shines persistently. The lower end of the generation cost range 
is close to that of gas-fired generation at current gas prices, but CSP is generally more 
expensive than coal-fired generation (in the absence of a carbon value), nuclear and 
wind power. The economics are expected to improve in the future, falling to around 
$100 per MWh in sunny areas by 2030.
Geothermal power
Electricity production from geothermal energy reached 60 TWh in 2006. Although, at 
the global level, geothermal power production has a very small share of the mix, it 
meets a significant share of the total electricity demand in Iceland (26%), El Salvador 
(20%),  Philippines  (18%),  Costa  Rica  and  Kenya  (14%  each),  and  Nicaragua  (11%). 
As  more  fields  are  exploited,  technologies  are  developed  for  deeper  drilling  into 
high-temperature fields and to enhance geothermal systems (hot dry rocks), power 
generation is projected to triple to almost 180 TWh by 2030, doubling geothermal’s 
share of 0.3% of the global electricity-generation mix in 2006. Most of the increase is 
expected to come from projects in the United States and non-OECD Asia.

Tide and wave power
Ocean-energy  power  systems  currently  make  the  smallest  contribution  of  all 
renewable energy sources. Tidal power stations are in operation in France, Canada, 
China, Russia and Norway. Wave power and ocean-current technologies are at an 
early stage of commercialisation, but there is strong interest on the part of several 
governments to develop them further. The United Kingdom is the leading country in 
which a specific market-based energy policy has been developed to encourage ocean 
energy  (IEA-OES,  2007).  This  policy  includes  capital  grants,  purchase  obligations, 
tradable certificates, guaranteed prices, and regulatory and administrative rules. 
In  the  Reference  Scenario,  tidal  and  wave  power  is  projected  to  reach  14  TWh 
worldwide in 2030, compared with less than 1 TWh now. 
Biomass for electricity 
Among all renewable energy sources, biomass is the largest contributor to global 
primary energy supply, amounting to 1 186 Mtoe in 2006. Of this, around 7% was 
used to produce 239 TWh of electricity. Approximately 44% of this electricity was 
generated in electricity-only generation plants, at around 20% conversion efficiency. 
The remainder was generated in CHP plants, where the heat is either used on-site (as 
in pulp and paper manufacturing plants) or sold and transported off-site, often for 
use in district-heating schemes in buildings and by industry. 
In the Reference Scenario, biomass use in power generation and heat plants increases 
by over 5% each year to reach close to 290 Mtoe of primary energy in 2030. Allowing 
for  a  projected  increase  in  fuel-to-electricity  conversion  efficiency  over  time 
(typically  18%  to  22%  for  woody  biomass  electricity-only  plants  in  2006,  rising  to 
25% by 2030), this will require approximately 1 200 Mt of biomass (approximately 40 
million truck loads) to be delivered annually to the generating plants. Over 860 TWh 
of electricity is projected to be generated by 2030, 60% of it in OECD countries. The 
share of biomass in global power generation doubles to 2.6%. The biggest increases in 
generation occur in the United States, Europe and China. 
Biofuels
Final demand for biofuels (transport fuels derived from biomass) worldwide reached 
24.4 Mtoe (0.6 mb/d adjusted for energy content) in 2006, up from only 10.3 Mtoe 
in 2000 and 6 Mtoe in 1990. 7  Biofuels represented only around 1.5% of total road-
transport  fuel  demand  in  2006.  North  America  is  the  world’s  largest  biofuels 
consumer (Table 7.2), followed by Latin America and the European Union, and most 
of the recent growth in biofuels use has come from the United States. Demand there 
grew by some 23% per year on average between 2000 and 2006. The United States 
overtook Brazil as the world’s largest biofuels consumer in 2004. 
7.  Preliminary data for 2007 shows biofuels demand at just over 0.8 mb/d (adjusted for energy content).

In the Reference Scenario, world biofuels supply is projected to climb to 118 Mtoe 
in 2030  (3.2  mb/d),  meeting  5%  of  total  road-transport  fuel  demand 8   (Figure  7.8). 
The projections  for  biofuels  have  been  revised  upwards  substantially  since  WEO-
2007, due to new policies in several countries and because of higher oil prices than 
assumed last year. We assume in the Reference Scenario that the biofuel mandates 
in  China  and  the  European  Union  will  be  met  after  a  lag  of  a  few  years  but  that 
biofuels in the United States in 2030 will attain only about 40% of the very ambitious 
target  in  the  2007  Energy  Independence  and  Security  Act.  Asia  and  OECD  Europe 
experience faster rates of growth, but in absolute terms these increases trail those

mandates, inter-fuel competition and supply potential. More detail about the prospects for supply to 2013 can

in  the  larger  North  American  market.  Biofuels  demand  in  the  OECD  Pacific  region 
remains  modest.  Growth  in  Latin  America  is  moderate,  a  consequence  of  the 
sizeable share of the market in Brazil already held by biofuels. In 2030, about 28% 
of  total  Brazilian  road-transport  fuel  demand  is  projected  to  be  met  by  biofuels 
(up  from  13%  today)  and  some  8%  of  the  market  in  the  United  States  (2%  today).  
Ethanol currently accounts for a much larger share of the global biofuels market than 
biodiesel. Over the Outlook period, demand for biodiesel is set to grow faster than 
ethanol, so that the share in energy terms of total biofuels coming from ethanol falls 
from 83% in 2006 to 79% in 2030 (Figure 7.8). The United States and Brazil remain the 
largest ethanol consumers. The European Union and Asia see the fastest growth in 
demand for biodiesel. Second-generation biofuels, based on ligno-cellulosic feedstocks 
using enzyme hydrolysis or biomass-to-liquids gasification technologies, are expected 
to become commercially viable, but only make a minor contribution in the second 
half of the projection period. Biofuels are almost entirely used for road transport, but  
recent demonstration projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan indicate 
there  may  be  potential  for  using  them  on  a  large  scale  in  aviation  and  shipping.
Several  countries  have  aggressive  policies  in  place  for  encouraging  the  production 
and  use  of  biofuels,  including  the  United  States,  where  the  Energy  Independence 
and  Security  Act  2007  mandates  a  significant  increase  in  both  first-  and  second-
generation  biofuels  use  by  2020.  China  has  a  target  to  2020  and  the  European 
Union  has  a  target  for  biofuels  to  meet  10%  of  road  transport  demand  by  2020. 
Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, South Africa, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico 
and  Canada  also  have  mandates  for  ethanol  blends.  Some  countries  have  recently 
started to reconsider their ambitious biofuels policies, including imported biofuels. 
This is due to concern about the environmental sustainability of production, overall 
greenhouse-gas  emissions  based  on  life-cycle  analysis,  and  the  impact  on  land  use 
and food prices (see Spotlight below). The European Union is reviewing its policies, 
while  India  and  Indonesia  have  already  scaled  back  their  incentives  for  biofuels.
To what extent are biofuels driving up the price of food?
Soaring  global  food  prices  have  recently  sparked  riots  in  many  countries, 
including Haiti, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Philippines and Indonesia. 
Food prices accelerated sharply in 2008, with grain prices more than doubling 
since  January  2006.  Over  60%  of  the  rise  in  food  prices  has  occurred  since 
January  2008.  Competition  from  biofuels  production  is  one  of  many  factors 
contributing to higher food prices. Other factors include:
 increasing  dietary  demand  for  meat  and  milk  products,  with  consequent   
increased demand for animal fodder; 
 high energy prices, which have pushed up the cost of fertilizer and other farm   
expenses, as well as food processing and distribution costs;
 poor  harvests,  due  to  extreme  weather  events  such  as  droughts  and   
destructive storms;

174 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
Today, global trade in ethanol represents just under 20% of total ethanol demand, but 
this share has been steadily rising from about 12% in 2002 (F.O. Lichts, 2008). Brazilian 
exports, including volumes re-exported from countries in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, 
account for about 45% of global trade. Brazil is the world’s largest exporter of biofuels; 
the United States is the world’s largest importer. The Netherlands, Germany and the 
United Kingdom are the largest importers in the European Union. Biodiesel derived from 
the declining value of the US dollar; and    
 international  and  national  agricultural  policies.  The  introduction  of  food-  
export  restrictions  by  some  nations  has  restricted  global  supply  and 
aggravated food shortages.
The recent increase in biofuels production has certainly boosted the demand for 
specific crops and, in some countries, has displaced land that could have been used 
for growing food. However two of the commodities most often associated with 
today’s food crisis, wheat and rice, are not major sources of biofuel feedstocks. 
On the other hand, higher prices for crude oil, gas and electricity have greatly 
affected the cost of producing, processing and transporting food worldwide. The 
US Government Accountability Office concludes that food aid organisations spend 
65% of their budgets on transportation. As a result of the rise in crude oil prices, 
the cost per food mile worldwide has soared. 
While it seems clear that rising biofuels output is contributing to the increase 
in food prices, there is no consensus on how large this factor is. A US Council of 
Economic Advisors study found the contribution of biofuels to the price increases 
of agricultural commodities to be only 3% (CEA, 2008) whereas a recent OECD 
report holds biofuels production responsible for 15% of the food price increases 
(OECD,  2008).  A  study  published  by  the  World  Bank  concludes  that  recent 
increases in biofuels production (and related consequences of low grain stocks, 
large land-use shifts, speculative activity and export bans) explain 70% to 75% 
of the increase in food prices (Mitchell, 2008). It is very difficult to compare 
these studies because of different methodologies, different time periods and 
other factors. More analysis is needed to determine the true impact of biofuels 
production, because of the very many assumptions and uncertainties involved in 
assessing its effects on food prices, commodity stocks, oil prices, and direct and 
indirect land-use change over various time horizons. 
Agricultural commodities will see much less competition between food, fibre and 
biofuels supply if productivity continues to rise at the growth rate seen in the 
past five decades as a result of better farm management, new technologies and 
improved crop varieties. Since so much available arable land needs irrigation, 
increased biofuel production in some regions will have implications for water 
resources. The uneven global distribution of natural resources results in regional 
differences, with many countries experiencing major land and water shortages. 
These differences impact on which countries have a comparative advantage in 
biofuels production.

palm oil, exported from Indonesia and Malaysia to the European Union, accounts for the 
majority of biodiesel trade. The United States and Brazil also export soybean biodiesel 
to EU countries. 
Numerous life cycle analysis studies have been conducted, but the various benefits of 
biofuels over conventional oil-based fuels for transport are still uncertain. Methods of 
allocating the emissions between co-products (such as high-protein animal meal from 
oilseeds  and  distillers  grain  from  corn)  are  being  determined.  The  greenhouse-gas 
emissions reduction potential per kilometre travelled is variable. It is highest in Brazil for 
ethanol produced directly from sugarcane because the fossil-fuel needs for processing 
are lower, as the sugar is fermented directly and the crushed stalk of the plant (known 
as bagasse) is used to provide heat and power in the production process rather than fossil 
energy. For each unit of sugar-based ethanol produced, only about 12% of a comparable 
unit of fossil energy is required (IEA, 2004). Overall, CO 2  emissions calculated on a life-
cycle basis are relatively low, at about 10% to 20% those of conventional gasoline. 
A  recent  IEA  analysis  of  60  studies  indicated  that  the  conversion  of  sugarbeet  into 
ethanol in Europe can yield reductions in well-to-wheels emissions of typically between 
40% and 60%, compared with gasoline (OECD, 2008). Estimates for the net reduction in 
greenhouse-gas emissions that are obtained from rapeseed-derived biodiesel in Europe, 
compared with conventional automotive diesel, are in a similar range. For corn-based 
ethanol in the United States, the emission savings are much lower, at only 10% to 30% 
per kilometre compared with petroleum-based fuels. However, many of these studies 
do not include emissions resulting from direct and indirect land-use change, which can 
be significant but are hard to measure.
The successful development of second-generation technologies using non-food biomass 
feedstocks would allow the use of a much wider array of feedstocks, including dedicated 
crops such as grasses and fast-growing trees. The reductions in greenhouse-gas and 
polluting  emissions  could  be  significantly  higher  than  those  associated  with  first-
generation ethanol and some of the fuels produced may be more suited for aviation, 
marine  and  heavy  transport  applications.  Ligno-cellulosic  ethanol  technologies  by 
bio-chemical  conversion  using  enzymes  are  the  focus  of  a  considerable  amount  of 
research into such second-generation biofuels, notably in the United States. Thermo-
chemical conversion, by gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of the gases into 
petroleum substitutes, is also under evaluation at a demonstration scale in Germany 
and elsewhere.  
There is no clear consensus about when second-generation technologies will become 
commercially  competitive,  even  with  high  oil  prices.  The  key  factors  in  achieving 
deployment are to prove the optimum technologies at a commercial scale, increase 
the  scale  of  production,  exploit  the  learning  curve,  and  apply  process  optimisation 
and  integration  techniques.  In  the  United  States,  Sweden,  Canada  and  elsewhere, 
demonstration ligno-cellulosic ethanol plants have recently been built. There are also 
plans to build several small-scale cellulosic bio-refineries over the next 10 to 15 years
in the United States. These will produce liquid transportation fuels such as ethanol, as 
well as bio-based chemicals and other bio-products used in industrial applications. The 
large Borregaard bio-refinery plant in Norway, employing 900 staff and using spruce

176 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
logs as feedstock, has been operating for several decades, producing fuel ethanol and 
other products. The US Department of Energy is providing $385 million between 2007 
and 2011 to support the development of six demonstration plants with the aim of making 
cellulosic  ethanol  cost-competitive  with  gasoline  by  2012.  The  capital  investment 
necessary to build cellulosic ethanol facilities, however, is significantly more than that 
of grain- or sugarcane-based facilities. As a result, the full commercialisation of these 
technologies hinges on further major cost reductions (IEA, 2008c). In the Reference 
Scenario, second-generation biofuels are not expected to penetrate the market on a 
fully commercial scale before 2020.
Renewables for heat
Renewable energy systems directly provided around 300 Mtoe of heat in 2006, excluding 
the heat supplied from the combustion of traditional biomass or from heating appliances 
using renewable electricity. Biomass, solar thermal and geothermal currently account 
for around 6% of total heat demand worldwide. Renewables heating is projected to grow 
to 516 Mtoe in 2030, boosting its share of total heat demand to about 7% by 2030. This 
increase comes mainly from increased use of biomass for space and process heating, and 
greater solar water heating in residential buildings. 
Commercial biomass used in boilers and stoves to provide space and process heat in 
the building and industry sectors amounted to 293 Mtoe in 2006 across all regions. This 
includes the heat from CHP installations that is consumed on site (mainly in industry). 
In the Reference Scenario, biomass consumption rises to 453 Mtoe in 2030. Most of the 
increase occurs in OECD countries, through growth in the number of CHP installations 
in industrial facilities and increased demand for the heating of buildings. In non-OECD 
countries, the use of modern biomass increases from 164 Mtoe in 2006 to 241 Mtoe in 
2030, leading to the more efficient and sustainable use of the local resource of basic 
forms of biomass. 
There  is  considerable  potential  for  solar  water  heating  to  grow  in  the  OECD,  since 
around 20% of total residential energy consumption is for heating water. Over 90% of 
OECD solar water heaters are installed in the residential sector, which is expected to 
remain the largest consumer to 2030, although use by the commercial sector will also 
grow. Those heaters already provide over 7.6 Mtoe of energy for water heating, with 
a small proportion used for swimming pool and space heating. There is also potential 
for  increasing  use  of  solar  water-heating  systems  in  non-OECD  countries,  since  the 
heaters are often manufactured locally and cheaply. China alone has around 60% of the 
world’s total installed capacity and collected around 3 Mtoe of useful solar heat in 2006. 
Globally, solar collection used for water and space heating (not including the passive 
solar heating of buildings) is projected to rise to about 45 Mtoe by 2030, with widespread 
global distribution.
Geothermal heat, used directly, accounted for around 3 Mtoe of space heating in 2006. 
The United States, Sweden, China, Turkey and Iceland are the leaders in such direct 
geothermal heat use. 9  In Iceland it contributes around 45% of the total end-use building 
9.  Geothermal heat use in China is not reported in IEA statistics, but it is estimated to be around 0.5 Mtoe.

heat demand. A third of the energy from this source comes from deep bores and the 
rest from millions of domestic scale, shallow ground-source heat pumps. Sweden alone 
has around one third of a million geothermal systems installed and projections show a 
significant increase will occur worldwide. Direct use of geothermal heat is projected 
to reach 18 Mtoe in 2030. 
The  costs  of  renewable  heating  technologies  vary  according  to  local  conditions, 
particularly the availability of the resource and the size of the market. Where the 
resources are abundant and conventional energy sources are expensive, they can be 
very  cost-competitive  with  conventional  fossil-fuel  or  electric-heating  systems  and 
require few, if any, government incentives (IEA, 2007). In China, for example, they 
are  a  relatively  cheap  option,  particularly  in  rural  areas  where  gas  and  electricity 
are not widely available. There is a large potential to reduce the installed costs of 
most renewable heating technologies through technological progress, training, mass 
production  (to  exploit  economies  of  scale)  and  improved  operating  performance. 
Government intervention can help address some of the barriers to wider deployment, 
including planning difficulties (see Part C).
Traditional biomass
“Traditional biomass” refers to fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural residues and animal 
dung. Most of this type of energy is used for lighting and direct heat in poor countries 
in Africa, Asia and Latin America, especially in rural areas where access to affordable, 
modern energy services is limited. 10  When used sustainably, the use of traditional 
biomass is not in itself a cause for concern. However the World Energy Outlook has 
for many years highlighted traditional biomass use because the way in which these 
resources are used to provide energy services — cooking, heating and lighting — often 
has a serious impact on health, economic productivity and the environment. More 
people die prematurely in poor countries from the health impacts associated with 
indoor air pollution from burning biomass than from malaria. In addition, a great 
deal of time and effort is devoted to fuel collection, usually by women and children. 
This restricts them from engaging in more productive activities, such as enrolling 
in school and running small enterprises. Exploitation of biomass resources can also 
result in local environmental damage, such as land degradation, deforestation and air 
pollution. These negative effects can be ameliorated with policies and programmes 
which promote improved cookstoves with chimneys, proper ventilation in kitchen 
design, efficient charcoal kilns and fuelwood plantations. 
Although accurate and detailed statistics are essential for proper policy and market 
analysis,  very  few  governments  report  on  the  use  of  traditional  biomass  at  the 
household level. In order to raise the awareness of household energy consumption in 
non-OECD countries, the IEA has attempted a global assessment and has estimated

on the burning of biomass resources in inefficient devices to meet their cooking and 
heating needs. In the absence of new policies, this number of people will rise to 2.7 
billion in 2030 (IEA, 2006). 
The  use  of  biomass  in  Africa  is  mainly  in  the  residential  and  services  sectors  for 
cooking and heating, and it is not expected to decline much over the Outlook period. 
Traditional use of biomass declines in non-OECD Asian countries, as rising  incomes 
enable  more  households  to  switch  to  cleaner-burning  fuels.  Use  of  biomass  in  the 
residential and services sectors declines in Latin America. 
Investment in renewable energy
In the Reference Scenario, total cumulative investment in modern forms of renewable 
energy in the period 2007 to 2030 amounts to $5.5 trillion (in year-2007 dollars). Most 
of the investment in renewables — 60% of the total — is for electricity generation, 
followed by investment in renewables for heat and biofuels, which account for 36% and 
4% of the total, respectively. Total investment in renewables for electricity generation 
in the Reference Scenario from 2007 to 2030 amounts to $3.3 trillion; this provides 
1 617 GW of additional capacity, mainly from an increase in hydro and wind capacity. 
Average  annual  capacity  additions  for  renewables-based  generation  in  the  period 
2007 to 2015 are projected to be 59 GW: some 27 GW for hydro and 32 GW for other 
renewables. Total annual capacity additions amount to 188 GW over the same period. 
In 2016-2030, hydropower capacity additions are 24 GW per year and other renewables 
49 GW per year, out of a total new generation capacity of 189 GW per year. Annual 
investment in renewables will climb accordingly. Over the whole of the projection 
period, the annual investment in new renewable electricity capacity is higher than that 
in fossil-fuel power plants (Figure 7.9). Renewables-based capacity accounts for 48% of 
total projected investment in electricity generation between 2007 and 2030.

ENERGY USE IN CITIES
Cities are a dynamic and vital part of global culture and are the main engines of   z
social, economic and technological development. According to UN projections, 
by 2030, cities will house 60% of the world’s population — equivalent to the total 
global  population  in  1986.  The  geographic  distribution  of  urban  population  is 
set to change: while global urbanisation in the first half of the 20th century was 
dominated by European cities, the majority of urban residents today live in Asia, 
despite the relatively low proportion there of city residents.
The scale and pattern of city energy use has significant implications both for   z
energy security and global greenhouse-gas emissions. Alert to the climate-change 
challenge, some city authorities are actively involved in reducing energy use and 
CO 2  emissions.
About two-thirds of the world’s energy — an estimated 7 900 Mtoe in 2006 — is   z
consumed in cities, even though only around half of the world’s population lives 
in urban areas. City residents consume more coal, gas and electricity than the 
global average, but less oil. 
Increases in urbanisation through to 2030 are projected to drive up city energy use   z
to almost 12 400 Mtoe in the Reference Scenario. By 2030, cities are responsible 
for 73% of the world’s energy use. Some 81% of the projected increase in energy 
use in cities between 2006 and 2030 comes from non-OECD countries.
Energy use per capita of city residents is slightly lower than the national average   z
in  the  United  States,  the  European  Union  and  Australasia  (Australia  and  New 
Zealand). By contrast, city residents in China use almost twice as much energy 
per capita as the national average, due to higher average incomes and better 
access to modern energy services. 
The gap between rural and city energy use per capita is assumed to narrow over   z
the projection period in China, but increasing urbanisation pushes up substantially 
the share of China’s energy used in cities.
By 2030, 87% of US energy will be consumed in cities, up from 80% in 2006. In the   z
European Union that figure will rise from 69% to 75% over the Outlook period. 
Australasian cities’ share of energy consumption will rise from 78% to 80% by 2030 
and Chinese cities account for 83% of Chinese energy consumption in 2030, up 
from 80% today.

Why focus on cities?
This chapter analyses the size and pattern of energy consumption in the world’s cities 
and towns today and projected developments through to 2030. 1  Cities (including towns) 
currently use over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of 
global CO 2  emissions. 2  Driven by growing urbanisation, city energy use is set to increase 
significantly through to 2030: in the Reference Scenario, energy use in cities rises to 
73% of the global total and CO 2  emissions to 76%. Given the scale of city energy use and 
CO 2  emissions, if cities and their authorities were to take action to mitigate climate 
change, this growth could be curtailed.
Cities are a dynamic and vital part of global culture and are the main engines of social, 
economic and technological development. From the small cities in the Pacific to the 
large  mega-cities  of  Asia  or  North  America,  cities  are  home  to  an  ever-increasing 
number  of  people.  But  to  provide  their  populations  with  the  myriad  of  services 
demanded, cities need large amounts of energy. Today, much of that energy is fossil-
fuel based. As the urban population, economic activity and wealth increase, urban 
energy use is set to grow. In 2008, half of the world’s population live in cities. According 
to UN projections, by 2030, cities will house 60% of the world’s population — equivalent 
to the total global population in 1986. At the same time, the geographic distribution of 
urban population is set to change: while global urbanisation in the first half of the 20th 
century was dominated by European cities, the majority of urban residents today live 
in Asia, despite the relatively low proportion there of city residents (Figure 8.1). Some 
of the fastest-growing cities are in Africa.

Box 8.1  z   Methodological issues and city energy data
There is no international consensus on the definition of a city. For reasons of 
data availability, in this Outlook “city” refers to all urban areas, from “mega-
cities” to smaller-scale urban settlements. City energy data are difficult to find, 
often incomplete and rarely in a format that allows comparisons between cities 
or with national data. Once data are acquired, analysis requires consideration 
of city boundary issues — what energy was consumed within the city, how to 
deal with energy supplied from outside the city (for example, power generation) 
and transit energy consumption (for example, vehicles passing through a city). 
Many cities are collecting their own data on energy consumption, but there is a 
lack of standard reporting methods. Various local government associations, for 
example the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), are 
attempting to establish more uniform data-collection methods.
The  global  estimates  of  city  energy  use  and  CO 2   emissions  presented  in  this 
Outlook have been calculated on the basis of the detailed energy-consumption 
projections for the 21 WEO regions in the IEA’s World Energy Model. City energy 
use was calculated using detailed analysis from four regions selected on the basis 
of the importance of these regions and the availability of city energy data: the 
United States, the European Union (split into two), Australia and New Zealand 
combined, and China. These regions account for over half of the world’s current 
energy consumption. For each of these four regions a detailed analysis of 2006 
data produced, for each fuel and by end-use sector, a per-capita ratio of city 
energy use to national energy use. These ratios were used to derive total final 
consumption in these four regions. The share of electricity consumed in cities 
was  used  to  apportion  national  power  generation,  regardless  of  whether  the 
electricity was generated in the city or not. This result was then used to calculate 
the  primary  energy  used  in  power  generation  associated  with  the  electricity 
consumed in cities. 3  Each of the four modelling region’s ratios were calculated 
using methods appropriate to the data available. 4
In  addition  to  these  four  detailed  regional  analyses,  selected  major  cities  in 
other regions for which detailed data were available, such as Tokyo, Moscow and 
Delhi, were used to further refine the ratios. We applied the most appropriate 
per-capita ratios, and the UN urbanisation projections, to the energy projections 
of the 21 WEO regions to calculate energy demand in cities at the global level 
through to 2030. For OECD regions, the differential between rural and urban 
per-capita energy consumption is assumed to remain constant over the Outlook 
period. For non-OECD regions, we assume that the differential converges over 
the Outlook period towards the urban/rural differential in OECD regions. Energy-
related CO 2  emissions were calculated using national carbon factors by sector and 
fuel (see Chapter 16 for detailed CO 2  emissions projections).

those at the regional level.

182 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
The scale and pattern of city energy use has significant implications both for energy 
security and global greenhouse-gas emissions. Alert to the climate-change challenge, 
some city authorities are actively involved in reducing energy use and CO 2  emissions. 
For  example,  London  has  an  aggressive  climate-change  policy  involving  a  range  of 
activities, such as working in partnership with private sector companies to design, 
finance, build, own and operate decentralised, low-energy and zero-carbon projects.
The analysis of global city energy use presented here is, to our knowledge, the most 
in-depth ever attempted. In view of data deficiencies and methodological challenges, 
however, the results should be treated as no more than indicative.
Current and projected energy use in cities
Our detailed analysis of current city energy use focuses particularly on four regions: 
the United States, the European Union, Australasia (defined here as Australia and New 
Zealand), and China. In the first three, city energy use per capita is roughly the same as 
the national average (Table 8.1). Cities in the European Union tend to use less energy 
per capita than US and Australasian cities, because of higher population densities, more 
extensive urban public transport systems, and more district heating. By contrast, cities 
in China are significantly more energy intensive per capita than the national average 
as a result of higher incomes and better availability of energy services compared with 
rural areas. The recent increase in Chinese national per-capita energy consumption — 
8.5% per year between 2000 and 2006 — has been driven partly by urbanisation. During 
that period the urban population in China grew by 3.2% per year, adding a further 
91 million inhabitants to Chinese cities.

Note: Fuel breakdowns for each region are in the regional section.
Based  on  the  results  of  our  analysis  of  primary  energy  use  in  cities  in  these  four 
regions, we estimate that around 7 900 Mtoe was consumed globally in cities in 2006 
(Table 8.2). This equates to 67% of the world’s primary energy demand in 2006, or 
more than four times that of China — the world’s second-largest energy consumer. The 
proportion of global energy consumed in cities is greater than the proportion of the 
world’s population living in cities. This is because city energy use is related to economic

activity, as well as city population. A large proportion of industrial and commercial 
activity, which consume a large proportion of total energy, is located in cities. For 
example, the majority of commercial buildings are located in cities. Urban energy use 
is also higher than rural energy use because, in the developing world (with urbanisation 
rates of 30% to 50%) residential per-capita energy use tends to be significantly higher in 
cities than in rural areas. This is because energy use is related to income and, as noted 
above in relation to China, city dwellers in the developing world tend to have higher 
incomes and better access to energy services. The income effect usually outweighs 
efficiency gains due to higher density settlement in cities. By contrast, city and rural 
residents in developed countries tend to enjoy similar levels of energy service access. 
Because of the rapid growth of cities in the developing world, their pattern of energy 
use will increasingly shape global energy use, though the rural/urban differential is 
expected to diminish somewhat.

* Average annual growth rate.
Globally, the share of natural gas (82%) and electricity (76%) consumed in cities is 
higher than the average of all fuels, and much higher than the share of the world’s 
population living in cities. This is due to the more extensive infrastructure in cities for 
energy distribution and higher appliance-ownership rates in developing cities relative 
to rural areas. Coal consumption in cities accounts for 76% of the global total, mainly 
from coal-fired power generation and coal use in urban-based industry in developing 
countries, such as China. The share of oil consumed in cities (63%) is smaller than the 
average of all fuels, due to higher penetration of electricity for heating and cooking, 
and wider use of urban public transport networks. The share of biomass and waste 
consumption, at 24% globally, is much lower in cities than in rural areas, consisting 
in  OECD  cities  largely  of  biofuel  consumption  and  biomass  in  industry  and  power 
generation.  In  developing  countries,  traditional  biomass  and  waste  is  still  used  for

domestic cooking and heating in cities, but consumption is much less per capita than 
in rural areas. Some 72% of other renewables are consumed in cities, mainly for power 
generation in OECD countries.
In the Reference Scenario, global city energy use is projected to grow by 1.9% per year 
(compared to an overall global growth rate of 1.6% per year), to 12 374 Mtoe in 2030. 
Its share of global energy use rises from 67% to 73% (Figure 8.2). Non-OECD countries 
account for 81% of the growth in energy use in cities over the Outlook period.

United States
Background
Over the past century, the United States has evolved from a largely industrial economy, 
dominated by the large cities of the Northeast and Midwest, towards a more dispersed, 
services-oriented economy. This shift has been characterised by growth in suburban 
areas and smaller cities, along with the expansion of urban areas in the Southwest 
which are dependent on cars and air conditioning. The proportion of the US population 
living in urban areas has increased from 40% in 1900 to over 80% today, with most 
population  growth  over  the  20 th   century  occurring  in  urban  areas  (USGCRP,  2001). 
Over the next 20 years, urban population in the United States is expected to grow by 
approximately 1% per year, reaching 87% of the total population by 2030.
The United States contributes just 5% of global population and 8% of urban population, 
but it is responsible for over 25% of global GDP, 5  nearly 87% of which is generated in 
metropolitan areas. 6  US energy policy is mainly controlled by the federal government,

though state-level authorities are increasingly influential. For example, although the 
United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, several states have voluntarily set 
their own targets which meet or exceed Kyoto targets. California aims to reduce its 
emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
in the eastern part of the United States and the Western Governors’ Initiative are 
multi-state climate change and greenhouse-gas emissions assessment and reduction 
initiatives.
Three  frequent  drivers  of  local  policy  in  the  United  States  are  the  security  of  the 
local energy supply, the affordability of energy services, and the long-term economic 
prospects  of  the  city.  New  York  City’s  2004  Energy  Policy  Task  Force  report  and 
2007 Citywide Sustainability Plan were explicit in warning that the city would soon be 
unable to meet peak demand for power and in identifying what steps must be taken 
to remedy the problem. In other cases, such as in San Francisco, local environmental 
concerns  have  been  pre-eminent,  expressed  particularly  in  efforts  to  force  local 
utilities  to  reduce  power-plant  emissions  levels.  Several  large  cities,  including  Los 
Angeles, Austin and Seattle, actually own and operate the utility providing local gas 
and electric services, giving them significant influence over the types of fuels used to 
generate power. 
Several  mayors,  including  those  of  Seattle,  New  York,  Salt  Lake  City,  Chicago  and 
San  Francisco,  have  made  climate  and  energy  planning  a  central  tenet  of  their 
administrations. They have also been vocal in rallying other cities to join in these 
efforts. In 2005, the mayor of Seattle spearheaded the formation of the US Conference 
of  Mayors  Climate  Protection  Agreement,  an  initiative  whereby  cities  pledge  to 
reduce local greenhouse-gas emissions to 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. As of July 
2008, 850 mayors across the United States — representing 80 million people — have 
signed  this  pledge.  In  2007,  the  mayor  of  New  York  hosted  the  second  C40  Large 
Cities for Climate Protection conference, an international initiative involving 40 of 
the largest cities around the world. Later that year, the mayor of New York spoke at 
the Bali Climate Change Conference on behalf of mayors around the world, calling 
on international climate negotiators to reflect on the role cities can have in global 
climate-change mitigation efforts.
Reference Scenario projections
City and urban areas account for 80% of total US primary energy demand (Table 8.6) 
driven by the high rate of urbanisation. This is significantly higher than the global 
average  of  around  67%.  US  cities  tend  to  have  slightly  lower  per-capita  energy 
consumption than the national average. Most urban efficiency gains are attributable 
to the transportation sector, where each urban resident consumes 11% less transport 
energy than the average US resident.

Total urban energy consumption in US cities is set to increase from 1 865 Mtoe in 
2006 to 2 229 Mtoe by 2030, growing at 0.7% per annum, almost double the 0.4% per 
annum growth at the US national level. This growth is driven by projected growth of 
the urban population in the United States, from 81% today to 87% by 2030. However, 
improvements in energy intensity at the national level result in a drop in per-capita 
energy consumption of urban residents from 7.6 Mtoe today to 7.0 Mtoe by 2030. 
Findings  for  the  United  States  as  a  whole  mask  strong  regional  variations  in  urban 
consumption, driven by large differences in individual city size, levels of urbanisation, 
climate, density, housing stock and per-capita income (Figure 8.3). In most coastal 
states, urban energy consumption is over 70% of the total; in many of the densely 
populated and highly urbanised states of the Northeast, urban energy consumption 
accounts for over 90% of state consumption. Per-capita consumption tends to be higher 
in urban areas east of the Mississippi and lower in urban areas west of the Mississippi.
European Union
Background
As one of the early centres of industrial transformation, the area that makes up the 
European  Union  is  characterised  by  high  levels  of  population  density,  urbanisation 
and energy use. With a current population of almost 500 million, accounting for 8% of 
the global population, the European Union generates 31% of global GDP. 7  Population 
projections are flat throughout the Outlook period, while urbanisation is projected to 
continue growing from 73% today to 80% by 2030.
Over the past decade, the European Union has been one of the driving forces behind 
international policy agreements for binding climate-protection targets. The European 
Union has set up an internal market for emission trading, which was operational before 
the Kyoto Protocol came in to force in February 2005.

Compared  with  other  world  regions,  the  European  Union  has  a  distinctive  form  of 
multi-level governance uniting 27 member states. It does not have a truly common 
and comprehensive energy policy, though a growing body of EU legislation does affect 
the energy sector in member countries. European Union directives cover a range of 
issues, including co-generation using renewable energy (combined heat and power), 
internal markets in electricity and gas, and energy efficiency. Additionally, industrial 
point-source greenhouse-gas emissions are traded in the world’s largest multi-national 
and multi-sector market for emission trading, the European Union Emissions Trading 
Scheme (see Chapter 17), covering more than 10 000 installations of the energy and 
industrial sectors. Urban and regional climate-protection strategies operate in parallel 
with the efforts at the national and supra-national scale.
Arrangements for, and the extent of, energy planning and policy at the urban and 
regional level vary considerably among member states, reflecting the heterogeneity 
of  the  structure  of  government  and  the  levels  of  local  participation  in  member 
states.  Some  members  of  the  European  Union  have  a  federal  organisation,  with 
extensive powers exercised at the urban and regional level. Cities like Berlin, Bremen 
or  Hamburg,  for  example,  are  federal  states  (Länder)  in  their  own  right,  able  to 
decide their individual energy programmes. Communes in the Nordic countries have 
considerable control over how to spend their tax income; and in the UK many planning 
decisions are devolved to the local authority or metropolitan level.
European cities have given a lead, internationally, to efforts to mitigate climate change. 
Almost all EU capitals and large cities have adopted, or are currently discussing, local 
climate-change action plans and greenhouse-gas emissions reduction targets that are, 
at times, more ambitious than those at the European and national levels. A specific 
characteristic of the European institutional framework for energy and climate policy is 
the importance of city networks, many of them partly financed by the European Union, 
as a way of sharing ideas and best practice. 
Reference Scenario projections
In 2006, urban areas accounted for 1 259 Mtoe, about 69%, of the total primary 
energy demand of the European Union. Final energy demand on a per-capita basis 
was about 3.5 Mtoe in urban areas, slightly lower than the EU average of 3.7 Mtoe 
per  capita.  Average  per-capita  consumption  in  rural  areas  was  even  higher,  at 
around 4.9 Mtoe.
Total  urban  primary  energy  consumption  in  the  European  Union  is  projected  to 
increase by 168 Mtoe over the projection period, reaching 1 427 Mtoe by 2030 — an 
average rate of growth of 0.5% per year. This is more than twice the rate of the 
European Union as a whole, which averages 0.2% per year and is accounted for by 
the growth in the urban share of the EU population to 80% by 2030 (Table 8.4). 
Urban  energy  consumption  increases  in  absolute  terms  as  the  urban  population 
rises, because improvements in energy intensity can not keep pace with the rise 
in population. Per-capita energy consumption increases from 3.5 Mtoe in 2006 to 
3.6 Mtoe by 2030 (Figure 8.4).

The fuel mix in cities differs considerably from the EU average. A higher share of grid-
based fuels, such as gas, heat and electricity, is consumed in cities, compared with the 
EU average for all fuels, whereas a lower proportion of coal, biomass and oil is used.

Background
Both  Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  developed  largely  through  agriculture  and 
natural resource production, and are now characterised by a few cities that are large 
relative to the national population. Urbanisation rates have been traditionally high 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
190 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
and continue to grow. In 2006, Australia had a population of 20.6 million people, with 
13.1 million (63.5% of the total population) living in eight regional capital cities. In 
2006, New Zealand’s population was 3.9 million people, with 1.9 million (48.5%) living 
in the three major urban areas. As most of the development of cities in Australia and 
New Zealand has taken place since the advent of the motor vehicle, the density of 
the residential urban population, approximately 1 500 people per square kilometre, is 
low. Cities tend to conform to a spread-out suburban model, with a denser inner ring 
(around a core that has become denser in the last decade) and gradual reduction of 
population density as the city expands.
Most major Australian cities are governed by multiple local governments, each of which 
is responsible for a portion of the urban area. Local governments have the power to 
enact  laws  and  implement  policies  relating  to  planning,  transport,  building,  waste 
and other local issues relating to energy management and climate change. In general, 
local governments in Australia can implement policy that affects energy demand, both 
stationary and mobile, but not energy supply. Their role as the planning authority, with 
responsibility for approving residential and commercial developments, is their main 
source of influence in relation to energy consumption and CO 2  emissions. 
New  Zealand  cities  are  governed  by  local  governments,  comprising  of  12  regional 
councils,  74  territorial  local  authorities  and  four  unitary  authorities  in  total.  Each 
local  authority  has  some  degree  of  control  over  energy-using  activities.  Typically, 
local governments (such as Christchurch and Auckland) have intervened on air quality 
issues and seek to take climate-change issues into consideration in developing other 
policies for which they are responsible. This has been particularly important in the 
development of the Long-Term Council Community Plans. Additionally, as the planning 
authority for wind farms and hydro developments, local governments have been at the 
forefront of the development of alternative energy systems. Local governments are 
not prevented from developing power generation facilities or operating an electricity- 
supply business but, to date, the focus of policy has been on managing demand through 
policy implementation or ambitious targets such as the zero net-emissions target of 
Wellington.
The commercial and services sector together now dominate the Australian economy, 
accounting for 60% of GDP in 2006. This proportion of the economy has been increasing 
for a number of years (ABS, 2007). Most commercial activity is office-based and has 
relatively low energy intensity. Residential energy consumption, on the other hand, 
has been increasing steadily for many years, driven by increasing appliance-ownership 
rates. Moving people and goods around sparsely populated countries such as Australia 
and New Zealand requires a large amount of energy.
Reference Scenario projections
In 2006, the cities in Australia and New Zealand consumed 78% of total energy demand, 
totalling 109 Mtoe (Table 8.8). Cities consumed 80% of total electricity and almost all 
natural gas in the end-use sectors, as there is little local distribution of natural gas 
in rural areas. Energy use per capita in cities is lower than the national average, at 
5.0 Mtoe in 2006, compared to 5.6 Mtoe for Australia and New Zealand as a whole.

The commercial sector is less energy intensive per capita than the residential sector, 
and industry and transport are the most energy-intensive sectors. Total urban energy 
demand  in  Australasia  is  projected  to  increase  from  109  Mtoe  today  to  136  Mtoe 
by  2030,  growing  at  0.9%  per  year.  This  is  slightly  quicker  than  the  0.8%  per  year 
consumption growth for the region as a whole. In addition to an increased use of oil 
in the rural residential sector, there is an increase in the use of biomass, due to the 
proximity  of  fuelwood  sources  and  lower  population  density  reducing  air  pollution 
concerns.
China
Background
China contributes 20% of the global population and 17% of the global urban population. 
In 2006, China’s urban population was 545 million, more than the entire population 
of the European Union. The UN projections see the current rate of urbanisation in 
China — around 40% — reaching 60% by 2030. Given that Chinese cities are more energy 
intensive per capita than rural areas, this will have significant implications for the 
national energy system and global energy markets.
In China, city governments have some influence over local energy supply and demand. 
one  reason  being  that  public  utilities  and  many  industries  are  still  owned  by  city 
authorities.  However,  cities  are  firmly  guided  by  national  policies,  which  they  are 
responsible for implementing. China’s 20% energy-intensity reduction target by 2010, 
in  its  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  illustrates  the  relationship  between  national  and  local 
government. This target was delegated to provincial level in the form of provincial 
performance targets. Although regional autonomy was strengthened through reforms in 
the 1990s, energy remains a strategic sector directed by the central government.
© OECD/IEA, 2008
192 World Energy Outlook 2008 - GLOBAL ENERGY TRENDS TO 2030
There is intense competition between cities in China to attract investment and, as 
a  consequence,  cities  act  to  address  concerns  about  energy  security  and  local  air 
pollution. Interventions by city authorities on energy matters tend to concentrate on 
four major fronts:
Clean  energy,  especially  by  encouraging  greater  penetration  of  natural  gas  and   
limiting the use of coal in the household and commercial sectors.
Action in the energy sector to facilitate economic structural change from primary to   
secondary industries and towards an enlarged tertiary sector.
Promoting energy efficiency.  
Improving public and mass-transportation systems.  
Climate change is becoming an increasingly important policy priority for both the national 
government and city governments. A number of energy and environmental policies at 
the city level have an impact on climate issues. Examples include the local air-pollution 
control policy associated with the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Shanghai’s vehicle-supply control 
policy, and policies to increase investment in renewable energy. Some Chinese cities have 
also  been  involved  in  international  efforts  to  develop  low  carbon  cities,  initiated  by 
organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund and others. New cities are putting greater 
emphasis on energy and climate issues. Dontang Eco-City, which is being built at the 
mouth of the Yangtze River close to Shanghai, is one example. Differences in the per-
capita energy use and CO 2  emissions of Chinese cities reflect a number of local conditions, 
of which scale and structure of the local economy are key factors (Figure 8.5).

Reference Scenario projections
The share of cities in China’s total primary energy demand in 2006 is estimated at 75% 
or about 1 424 Mtoe (Table 8.6). The per-capita energy use of urban areas in China is 
about 80% higher than in the country as a whole. On average, each urban citizen in

China consumes 2.6 Mtoe, compared with 1.4 Mtoe nationally, reflecting higher urban 
incomes. Coal provides about 87% of urban primary energy. Natural gas use in cities in 
China is increasing rapidly. Beijing leads this trend, and the share of natural gas has 
dramatically increased since 2000. Further urbanisation and economic development 
should  lead  to  a  convergence  of  urban  and  rural  energy  intensity.  Cities  will  have 
an increasing role in shaping the energy profile of China, with urban areas providing 
great  opportunities  for  large-scale  policy  interventions  for  managing  the  overall 
energy system. By 2030 cities in China are projected to consume 3 220 Mtoe. The 
proportionate effect on energy consumption of strong urbanisation growth is partially 
offset by the fact that increasing energy consumption in rural areas is also expected 
to grow strongly through the Outlook period, with the net result that the share of city 
energy use in China increases to 83% by 2030. Phasing out of coal, and greater use of 
natural gas and liquefied petrolum gas, in residential and commercial sectors in urban 
areas is set to increase.

PART B
OIL AND GAS 
PRODUCTION 
PROSPECTS
© OECD/IEA, 2008
PREFACE
How much oil and gas is there in the ground and how much can be economically 
produced? Over the years to 2030, what investment will be required to exploit these 
reserves and can we be confident that it will be forthcoming? These are the questions 
addressed in Part B.
The oil and gas is there, but the sums required to exploit them are daunting. Remaining 
reserves of oil continue to rise, despite growing consumption, and the gas-reserves 
position is still more comfortable. But the exploitation costs have risen fast and, as we 
become increasingly dependent on OPEC countries and their national oil companies, 
the opportunities for international oil companies diminish. If prices stay high, the 
depletion policies of some producing countries become increasingly restrictive.
On the basis of a detailed field-by-field analysis of production trends at 800 of the 
world’s largest oilfields and the assessment of the prospects for reserves growth and 
new discoveries, Chapters 9, 10 and 11 examine in detail the evidence on available 
resources and the prospects for future supply. The demands are great. Between now 
and 2015 some 30 mb/d of new production capacity needs to be brought on stream to 
compensate for the decline in production from existing fields and meet the growth in 
demand. Chapter 12 similarly reviews the prospects for gas.
Chapter 13 quantifies the investment needed to exploit oil and gas resources on the 
required scale and, together with Chapter 14, which looks at the structural changes 
taking  place  in  the  upstream  industry,  assesses  whether  the  prevailing  conditions 
warrant confidence that the investment will be forthcoming.
Finally in this Part B, oil and gas prospects in oil- and gas-rich sub-Saharan Africa 
are  analysed,  exposing  potential  government  earnings  from  oil  and  gas  of  some
$4 trillion over the years to 2030 — many times more than would be required to 
bring basic modern energy services to the energy-poor of these countries. But will 
these government resources be devoted to this cause, which can underpin economic 
development?

Chapter 9 - Turning oil resources into reserves 197
CHAPTER 9
TURNING OIL RESOURCES INTO 
RESERVES
How much is left to produce?
The world is far from running short of oil. Remaining proven reserves of oil   z
and natural gas liquids worldwide at the end of 2007 amounted to about 1.2 to 
1.3 trillion barrels (including about 0.2 trillion barrels of Canadian oil sands). 
These reserves have almost doubled since 1980. Though most of the increase 
has  come  from  revisions  made  in  the  1980s  in  OPEC  countries  rather  than 
from  new  discoveries,  modest  increases  have  continued  since  1990,  despite 
rising consumption. The volume discovered  has fallen well below the volume 
produced in the last two decades, though the volume of oil found on average 
each year since 2000 has exceeded the rate in the 1990s thanks to increased 
exploration activity (with higher oil prices) and improvements in technology. 
Ultimately  recoverable  conventional  resources  —  a  category  that  includes   z
initial proven and probable reserves from discovered fields, reserves growth 
and  economically  recoverable  oil  that  has  yet  to  be  found  —  amounts  to   
3.5 trillion barrels (leaving aside about 0.5 trillion additional barrels which 
might come from new sources not yet assessed and the application of new 
technologies).  Only  a  third  of  this  total  has  been  produced  up  to  now. 
Undiscovered resources account for about a third of the remaining recoverable 
oil, the largest volumes of which are thought to lie in the Middle East, Russia 
and the Caspian region. 
Future  reserves  growth  will  depend,  to  a  large  extent,  on  increases  in  the   z
recovery factor, which is estimated to average about 35% worldwide today. Such 
increases, through secondary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and 
other factors, could make a big difference to recoverable reserves, prolonging 
the production life of producing fields and postponing the peak of conventional 
oil production: a mere one percentage point increase in the average recovery 
factor at existing fields alone would add more than 80 billion barrels (two years 
of current consumption) or 6% to the world’s proven oil reserves. 
Non-conventional  oil  resources  are  also  large.  Oil  sands  and  extra-heavy  oil   z
resources  in  place  worldwide  amount  to  around  6  trillion  barrels,  of  which 
between 1 and 2 trillion barrels may be ultimately recoverable economically. 
These  resources  are  largely  concentrated  in  Canada  (mainly  in  Alberta) 
and  Venezuela  (in  the  Orinoco  Belt).  There  is  additional  potential  from  oil 
shales,  but  their  production  cost  and  the  environmental  impact  of  their 
commercialisation are very uncertain.

198 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The total, long-term potentially recoverable oil resource base, including extra-  z
heavy oil, oil sands and oil shales, is estimated at around 6.5 trillion barrels. 
Adding  coal-to-liquids  and  gas-to-liquids  increases  this  potential  to  about 
9 trillion barrels. Of these totals, nearly 1.1 trillion barrels have already been 
produced, for the most part at a cost of up to $30 per barrel in year-2008 dollars 
(excluding taxes and royalties). The cost of exploiting remaining conventional 
resources typically ranges from $10 to $40 per barrel, while exploitation of oil 
sands costs between $30 and $80. EOR costs vary between $10 and $80 per barrel 
and oil shales from $50 to well over $100.
Classifying hydrocarbon resources
The amount of fossil-hydrocarbon resources (or hydrocarbons initially in place) on the 
earth is finite. These resources can be categorised according to the degree of certainty 
that they exist and by the likelihood that they can be extracted profitably. Several 
different protocols exist for classifying resources, many of them developed by national 
organisations. 1  This has caused confusion and inconsistency in measuring and comparing 
resources. 
Efforts have been made to achieve a harmonised international approach. The Society 
of  Petroleum  Engineers  (SPE),  the  World  Petroleum  Council  (WPC),  the  American 
Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation 
Engineers  (SPEE)  published  jointly  in  2007  guidelines  on  resource  definition  and 
classification,  called  the  Petroleum  Resources  Management  System  (PRMS).  This 
system is compatible with the 2004 UN Framework Classification for Fossil Energy and 
Mineral Resources (UNFC), which has been developed by the UN Economic Commission 
for  Europe  (UNECE).  The  PRMS  classifies  resources  and  reserves  according  to  the 
level  of  certainty  about  recoverable  volumes  and  the  likelihood  that  they  can  be 
exploited profitably (Figure 9.1). The main innovation concerns a shift to a project-
based methodology whereby estimated recoverable quantities are related to actual 
investment.  The  classification  applies  to  both  conventional  and  non-conventional 
resources. 
Under the PRMS and UNFC systems, “proved reserves” (or 1P reserves) are hydrocarbons 
that have been discovered and for which there is a 90% probability that they can be 
extracted  profitably  (on  the  basis  of  assumptions  about  cost,  geology,  technology, 
marketability  and  future  prices).  “Proved  and  probable  reserves”  (2P  reserves) 
include additional volumes that are thought to exist in accumulations that have been 
discovered and that are expected to be commercial, but with only a 50% probability 
that they can be produced profitably. “Possible reserves” (3P reserves) add to the 
2P reserves volumes in discovered fields with a 10% probability of being profitable. 
Estimates of reserves in each category change over time as the underlying assumptions 
are modified or new information becomes available.

Chapter 9 - Turning oil resources into reserves 199
9
Deterministic and probabilistic methodologies are used to estimate reserves. Reservoir 
engineers typically apply a number of different formulas involving a range of variables 
and probabilities to test the sensitivity of a preferred approach or set of assumptions. 
Increasingly, companies rely on seismic data to map out hydrocarbon reservoirs. But 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which imposes reserves-reporting 
standards for companies quoted on US stock exchanges, until now has not allowed 
companies to book reserves on undrilled acreage on the basis of seismic data alone: 
it also requires evidence from drilling. The price of oil or gas is a key parameter for 
assessing the potential profitability of reserves. As prices rise, some reserves that were 
previously  classified  as  non-commercial  may  become  potentially  profitable  and  be 
moved into the possible, probable or proven category.

While progress has been made in establishing a harmonised system of defining and 
classifying resources, the way those resources are measured in practice still differs 
widely by country and by jurisdiction. There is no internationally agreed benchmark 
or legal standard as to how much proof is needed to demonstrate the existence of a 
discovery, nor about the assumptions to be used to determine whether discovered 
oil can be produced profitably. This is, in part, because different reporting systems 
are designed for different purposes. Standards for financial reporting, such as SEC 
rules, are typically the strictest and result in the lowest estimates. In addition, the 
extent of the requirements for companies to release information on resources and 
reserves differs markedly. Auditing reserves and publishing the results are far from 
universal practice. Many oil companies, including international oil companies, use 
external auditors and publish the results, but most national oil companies do not. 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
200 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
These inconsistencies have created confusion over just how much oil can reasonably 
be expected to be produced commercially in the long term. Box 9.1 explains how 
resources are defined and measured in the Outlook.
Box 9.1  z   Defining and measuring conventional and non-conventional 
hydrocarbon reserves in the 
WEO
The PRMS classification applies to both conventional and non-conventional 
resources.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  in  this  analysis,  non-conventional  oil 
includes  extra-heavy  oil,  oil  sands,  oil  shales,  coal-to-liquids  and  gas-to-
liquids. It does not include vegetable oil derived from biomass. But there is 
also a category of oil which, though considered conventional, can be extracted 
only using new technologies which are not yet fully developed and/or involves 
pioneering work in frontier areas, such as ultra-deepwater. Included in this 
category is oil recovered from as-yet unopened areas of the Arctic and from 
new deepwater and ultra-deepwater resources, together with additional oil 
recovered  from  new  enhanced  oil  recovery  projects.  There  are  very  large 
uncertainties about the extent of economically recoverable resources in this 
category  and  this  “conventional  oil  produced  by  unconventional  means”, 
which  is  discussed  below,  is  often  not  included  in  estimates  of  ultimately 
recoverable resources. For example, it is not included in the latest figures 
from the US Geological Survey. We make no systematic estimates for each of 
the various components of this category, but Figure 9.10 in the last section 
of this chapter gives a broad illustration of their potential size. Additional 
oil  resulting  from  reserves  growth  is  customarily  included  in  conventional 
oil,  except  where  the  reserves  growth  derives  from  the  new  EOR  projects 
mentioned above. 
A number of bodies, including the IEA, UNECE, SPE, WPC, AAPG and the SEC, are 
working together to try to harmonise the way in which different types of reserves are 
measured  in practice, with the aim of bringing transparency to resource reporting. 
In particular, there is a need to ensure that financial and accounting standards for 
hydrocarbon exploration and production are consistent with business and technical 
practice. In recognition of this, the SEC has itself proposed new rules on reserves 
disclosure (Box 9.2), and efforts are being made to ensure that harmonised rules 
on reporting and communicating reserves estimates are implemented as widely as 
possible. Progress is hampered by the reluctance to accept new standards on the 
part of countries and industries that have developed their own reporting systems, 
and difficulties in adapting national systems to a universal system. Some appreciable 
progress has been achieved in data transparency on oil production, thanks to the 
Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI). A similar approach could be considered to improve the 
quality of the data on reserves. A successful effort to address both concerns would 
contribute to better decision making by all interested parties.

Box 9.2  z   Proposed new SEC reserves-reporting rules
In July 2008, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced proposed 
revised oil and gas company reporting requirements aimed at providing investors 
with  a  more  accurate  and  useful  picture  of  the  oil  and  gas  reserves  that  a 
company holds. Reflecting the significant changes that have taken place in the 
oil and gas industry since the adoption of the original reporting requirements 
more than 25 years ago, the SEC proposal permits companies to take into account 
improved  technologies  and  alternative  extraction  methods,  enabling  them  to 
provide  investors  with  additional  information  about  their  reserves.  Specific 
changes to the rules include the following:
Allowing for the use of new technologies to determine which reserves may   z
be  classified  as  proved,  if  those  technologies  have  been  demonstrated 
empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.
Permitting companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to   z
investors. Current rules limit disclosure to proved reserves only.
Allowing previously excluded resources, such as mineable oil sands, to be   z

Latest estimates of conventional oil reserves
and resources
Proven reserves
Various organisations compile and report data on oil and gas reserves, using national and 
company sources. The most widely quoted primary sources of global proven oil reserves 
(1P) data are the Oil and Gas Journal (O&GJ) and the World Oil Journal. OPEC compiles 
data for its member countries, and publishes this together with data for other countries 
drawn from BP. IHS compiles data for 2P reserves only. Other organisations, including BP, 
publish their own global estimates based mainly on data from primary sources.

202 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Current estimates of remaining economically recoverable reserves of oil worldwide do not 
vary greatly, despite differences in the way they are reported. O&GJ puts global proven 
oil reserves (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) at the end of 2007 at 1 322 billion barrels, 
while World Oil, at the other end of the spectrum, reports 1 120 billion barrels (Figure 9.2). 
The IHS estimate is 1 241 billion barrels, implying a lower figure for proven, 1P reserves. 
The O&GJ estimate includes 173 billion barrels of Canadian oil sands. The totals reported 
by BP, 2  IHS and World Oil exclude Canadian oil sands; World Oil also excludes NGLs.

According to BP, which compiles published official figures, proven reserves worldwide 
have almost doubled since 1980 (Figure 9.3). Most of the changes result from increases 
in official figures from OPEC countries, mainly in the Middle East, as a result of large 
upward revisions in 1986-1987. They were driven by negotiations at that time over 
production quotas and have little to do with the discovery of new reserves or physical 
appraisal work on discovered fields. The official reserves of OPEC countries have hardly 
changed since then, despite ongoing production. 
Globally, remaining proven reserves have increased modestly but steadily since 1990, 
despite  continuing  consumption  growth.  According  to  O&GJ,  reserves  increased  by 
14.2 billion barrels, or 1.2%, in 2007, mainly thanks to upgrades in Venezuela, Brazil, 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Angola. OPEC countries’ reserves, at 930 billion barrels 
based on official data, represent 77% of the world total (using the O&GJ estimate). The 
global reserves-to-production ratio (R/P), based on current levels of production, is in 
the range of 40 to 45 years, depending on the source and whether non-conventional 
resources are included. This level has changed little in the last few years.
2.  In  its  last  two  Statistical  Reviews,  BP  has  included  separate  estimates  of  Canadian  oil  sands. Those 
reserves are estimated at 152.2 billion barrels at end-2007 (BP, 2008).

A  growing  share  of  the  additions  to  reserves  has  been  coming  from  revisions  to 
estimates  of  the  reserves  in  fields  already  in  production  or  undergoing  appraisal 
(reserves  growth)  rather  than  from  new  discoveries  (see  the  next  section  for  a 
discussion  of  the  role  of  reserves  growth).  The  volume  of  oil  in  new  discoveries 
has  fallen  well  below  the  volume  of  oil  produced  in  recent  years  (Figure  9.4). 
Discoveries dropped from an average of 56 billion barrels per year in the 1960s to 
13  billion barrels  per  year  in  the  1990s.  The  number  of  discoveries  peaked  in  the 
1980s, but it fell sharply in the 1990s. The fall in both the number of discoveries and 
the volume of oil discovered has been most acute in the Middle East and the former 
Soviet  Union.  By  contrast,  discoveries  rose  in  Africa,  Latin  America  and  Asia.  The 
drop in discoveries worldwide was largely the result of a fall in exploration activity 
in the regions with the largest reserves (where access by international companies 
is most difficult) and a fall in the average size of the fields that have been found.

These factors more than offset the effect of an improved exploration drilling success 
rate, which has increased by a factor of two in the last 50 years, from one out of six 
wildcat wells to one out of three today (Harper, 2005). The downward trend in the 
volume of oil found has reversed slightly in the current decade, thanks to increased 
exploration activity (with higher oil prices), with an average 16.4 billion barrels per 
year discovered since 2000. The excess of production over cumulative discoveries 
over the same period is 400 billion barrels.
Ultimately recoverable resources
Reserves  estimates  give  an  indication  of  how  much  oil  could  be  developed  and 
produced in the near to medium term. The total volume of oil which might ultimately 
be produced commercially is known as ultimately recoverable resources. This category 
includes oil initial proven and probable reserves from discovered fields (including oil 
already produced), both in production and yet to be developed, reserves growth (see 
below) and hydrocarbons that are yet to be found. From a larger resource base, more 
oil is likely to progress into the proven category, deferring the peak in global production 
and permitting more oil to be produced. 
The US Geological Survey, a federal government agency, is the world’s leading source of 
estimates of recoverable hydrocarbon resources. It carried out a major assessment of the 
world’s conventional oil and gas resources in 2000, based on raw data for 1995 (USGS, 
2000). Since that time, it has reassessed some basins and assessed some others for the first 
time. Our current estimates of initial and remaining ultimately recoverable conventional 
resources are shown in Table 9.1. These take account of the USGS updates, new remaining 
reserve estimates from IHS and cumulative oil production to the end of 2007, but exclude 
the “conventional oil produced by unconventional means” discussed later in Box 9.3. On 
this basis, using the mean figures of the USGS, the world’s current ultimate recoverable 
conventional oil and NGL resources are estimated to amount to just under 3.6 trillion 
barrels. Of these, cumulative production to date is 1.1 trillion barrels. Remaining resources 
amount to over 2.4 trillion barrels. Reserves growth accounts for around 400 billion barrels, 
with the largest contribution to reserves growth (in proportion to the reserves) over the last 
decade from the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Remaining recoverable resources 
are largest in the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian region.
Despite  the  thoroughness  of  the  assessments,  there  are  considerable  uncertainties 
surrounding the estimates of ultimate recoverable resources — a point highlighted by the 
USGS itself. In addition to the mean value mentioned above, the USGS provides alternative 
numbers based on different probabilities, ranging from 2 400 billion barrels with a 90% 
probability  of  at  least  that  amount  being  available  to  4  495  billion  barrels  with  a  5% 
probability (not adjusted for reserves growth since the 2000 assessment was released).  
The USGS recently reviewed trends in discoveries and reserves growth in the period 
1996-2003, comparing them with their original estimates of the long-term potential 
(Klett et al., 2007). It found that, based on IHS data, 28% of the estimated additions 
(mean  value)  to  2P  oil  reserves  from  reserves  growth  (to  2025)  had  already  been 
achieved  —  almost  exactly  in  line  with  the  pace  of  growth  predicted  in  the  2000 
assessment (Figure 9.5). The rate of discovery lagged this figure — 11 % of estimated 
undiscovered oil volumes had been discovered by 2003 — but the ultimate timescales

Chapter 9 - Turning oil resources into reserves 205
9
are not directly comparable. Overall, 71% of the total additions to reserves came from 
reserves growth and only 29% from discoveries. In all areas except for sub-Saharan 
Africa and Asia-Pacific, reserves growth outpaced discoveries. For natural gas, a higher 
proportion of estimated potential from reserves growth had actually been attained 
(51%) but a smaller share of the potential from discoveries (less than 10%). The share of 
reserves growth in the total reserve additions between 1996 and 2003 was 79%.

206 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Arctic resources
The USGS continues to assess global hydrocarbon resources, focusing on particular 
regions that it judges to be worthy of more in-depth study. In 2005 it launched a 
major reassessment of the Arctic region (Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal, CARA), 
and released the final results in July 2008. Earlier USGS estimates of undiscovered oil 
and gas in the Arctic, amounting to 25% of total undiscovered resources worldwide, 
actually  included  continental  areas  in  Western  Siberia  below  the  Arctic  Circle.
Box 9.3  z   Potential for exploiting Arctic resources
Oil and gas fields in the arctic frontier area, north of the Arctic Circle, currently 
account  for  a  small  share  of  the  world’s  hydrocarbon  production.  But  that 
share  could  rise  significantly  in  the  coming  decades  as  technical  challenges 
are addressed and costs lowered. The Arctic presents many of the high-profile 
challenges  associated  with  deepwater  operating  conditions:  remoteness, 
personnel safety, environmental footprints and high costs. An extreme climate 
and hazards from ice and icebergs add to these difficulties. Significant knowledge 
of operations in the Arctic was gained in the 1960s and 1970s in Russia, Canada 
and Alaska. More recently, developments in the Yamal Peninsula, the Snohvit 
LNG project in the Barents Sea and the offshore Sakhalin projects in Russia, in 
Arctic-like conditions, have added to that experience. Some prospects are near 
existing infrastructures such as the North Slope of Alaska and the Pechora Sea in 
Russia. Other basins are far from areas that have already been explored or where 
resources have already been exploited. 
The  ability  to  drill  wells  in  ice-covered  seas  will  be  critical  to  the  efficient 
development  of  Arctic  resources.  There  is  generally  a  limited  operational 
window  for  existing  drilling  units  in  ice-covered  waters,  though  the  receding 
ice-cap  will  increase  the  size  of  this  window.  Fit-for-purpose  arctic  drillships 
are being developed in Norway for water depths of more than 80 metres. New 
technologies such as subsea and sub-ice drilling are being considered. A majority 
of  offshore  fields  will  most  likely  be  developed  using  subsea  technology  and 
well stream transport to land, as was the case with the Snohvit field in Norway 
(Johnsen,  2008).  For  easing  oil  flow  at  the  surface,  effective  solutions  are 
still to be developed, including fluid conditioning, pressure-boosting and well-
intervention technologies. Oil transport by ships is typically done by tankers with 
a capacity of 100 000 barrels, towed by icebreakers. A tanker being developed by 
StatoilHydro will be able to carry more than 500 000 barrels of oil (or half as much 
as a standard very large crude carrier) without the need for icebreakers, except 
where there are large ice ridges.
Estimates of exploration and production costs in the Arctic vary widely, mainly 
as a function of the distance from existing fields and the nature of the operating 
environment. Indicative costs for an offshore arctic production field, including 
drilling, production facilities, and operating and decommissioning components, 
are currently about $35 to $40 per barrel for the easiest resources to exploit.

The  CARA  (USGS,  2008)  study  covers  31  geological  provinces,  of  which  25  are 
considered to hold hydrocarbon potential, and 69 assessment units. The new study 
shows increased potential gas resources — 1 669 trillion cubic feet of gas (30% of 
the world’s undiscovered conventional gas) — but lower quantities of oil — 90 billion 
barrels (mean value) of undiscovered conventional oil and 44 billion barrels of NGLs 
(13% of the world’s total undiscovered conventional liquids). 
Deepwater and ultra-deepwater resources
Estimates  of  the  recoverable  conventional  oil  located  in  deepwater  (water  depths 
between 400 meters and 1 500 metres) and ultra-deepwater (water depths greater than 
1  500 meters)  lie  between  160  and  300  billion  barrels  (IEA,  2005).  Over  70%  of  these 
resources are in Brazil, Angola, Nigeria and the United States. Most production to date 
has occurred in the US Gulf of Mexico, but production is rising in Angola and Brazil (where 
several large discoveries have been made in the stratum below the salt deposits, the pre-
salt layer, Box 9.4). New developments are underway in Mexico, Nigeria, Southeast Asia 
and the Mediterranean Sea. Other areas of deepwater exploration interest include the 
UK Atlantic margin, the Black Sea, India and the Arctic. Cumulative global oil discoveries 
in deepwater offshore areas, plotted against the number of exploration wells, remain on
Box 9.4  z   Pre-salt deepwater potential in Brazil
The  Santos  Basin  offshore  Brazil  is  one  of  the  most  promising  regions  for 
deepwater production. Several discoveries have been made in the pre-salt (or 
sub-salt) section of the Basin. These include the Tupi and Jupiter condensate/
gas fields in 2007, each with estimated recoverable reserves of up to 8 billion 
barrels  of  oil  equivalent,  and,  in  2008,  the  Carioca  field.  Brazil’s  proven  oil 
and gas reserves are expected to be revised sharply upwards once these and 
other  new  finds  have  been  appraised.  Development  plans  have  already  been 
submitted for some of them. Production testing on Tupi, located in more than 
2 000 metres of water and 4 000 metres below the seabed, is due to begin in 
2009. Petrobras, which holds a 65% stake in the field, plans pilot production of 
around 100 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) in 2011-2012 and at least 200 kb/d 
within 10 to 15 years. Peak output of as much as 1 mb/d is possible. Depending on 
other deepwater finds, the Santos Basin could contribute the bulk of the increase 
in Brazil’s total oil production over the projection period.  
A host of technical difficulties need to be overcome for these pre-salt finds to 
be developed: the complexity of drilling deviated and horizontal wells through 
the salt zones, slow drilling rates and the need, in some cases, to hydraulically 
fracture  wells.  Secondary  recovery,  using  water  or  alternated  water-gas 
injection, creates additional challenges. Finally, once the wells start producing, 
flow  assurance  requires  a  careful  strategy  for  preventing  the  deposition  of 
paraffins and other substances in production lines. Adding to the complexities are 
the handling of associated natural gas and CO 2 , and high pressures.

a  linear  trend  (Figure  9.6),  suggesting  that  more  large  finds,  such  as  the  recent 
Brazilian Tupi field, are likely to be made in the future. Future prospects are classified 
here as conventional oil produced by unconventional means.

The oil and gas industry has made great strides in developing technologies to explore 
for and produce oil and gas in ever deeper water locations. Total world production 
from deepwater fields rose from less than 200 kb/d in 1995 to over 5 million barrels 
per day (mb/d) in 2007. Production from ultra-deepwater fields began only in 2004 
and is expected to exceed 200 kb/d by 2010.  The average water depth of production 
wells has more than tripled since the mid-1990s, technical advances having enormously 
increased the maximum water depth in which wells can be drilled. The 3 000 metres 
water depth mark for wells drilled was exceeded by the recent Chevron Toledo project 
in the Gulf of Mexico. A record for the combined depth of water and the well itself 
was set by another Chevron project, called Knotty Head, also in the Gulf of Mexico. 
In addition, the time needed to bring deepwater fields into commercial production 
is  shortening  (Figure  9.7).  Improvements  in  seismic  data  gathering  and  processing 
technologies that enable images to be prepared of areas located beneath thick layers 
of salt zones are raising the discovery rate.
Nonetheless,  wells  drilled  in  ultra-deepwater  locations  face  major  technological 
challenges,  including  high  underground  temperatures  and  pressures  (which  require 
special metals), the behaviour of salt canopies (which can be more than 3 000 metres 
thick) and near-surface gas zones. In addition, complex hydraulic fracturing may be 
needed to maintain the structure of the reservoir during production and to avoid the 
in-flow of sand (Couvillion, 2008). The design of sub-sea production systems needs to 
evolve to provide assurance of the unimpeded flow of hydrocarbons and to extend the 
production life of fields.

Although there is thought to be a considerable amount of oil in place in deepwater 
locations, how much is recoverable will hinge on the balance between development 
costs and oil prices (as of course, is true of all oil reserves, onshore and offshore). 
Strong demand for deepwater drilling rigs (semi-submersible platform and drillships, 
collectively  referred  to  as  floaters)  has  driven  up  rig  rates  in  recent  years  (see 
Chapter 13). At mid-2008, there was a near-record tally of floaters under construction, 
comprising 44 semi-submersibles and 30 drillships. Most of the new floaters will be 
capable of drilling in water depths greater than 7 000 feet (2 300 metres), and half of 
them could drill in more than 10 000 ft (3 300 metres) of water. The majority of the 
more than 100 offshore rigs built in the 1970s, which are expected to be retired in the 
next five years, are capable of drilling only in shallow water (less than 400 metres). 
Investment in deepwater drilling is expected to continue to grow: from $58 billion 
in 2001-2005 to $108 billion in 2008-2012, with 85% going to the “golden triangle” of 
North America, Brazil and West Africa, according to recent industry forecasts (Douglas-
Westwood, 2007). Asia accounts for a further 10%, with activity in Indonesia, India 
and Malaysia. Sub-sea wells represent the largest components of capital costs (41%), 
followed by platforms (32%), pipelines and control lines (16%) and sub-sea hardware 
(9%). At present, a minimum oil price of $45 in the Gulf of Mexico and $60 in Angola is 
needed to yield a 12% return on investment.
Reserves growth and enhanced oil recovery
Reserves growth, which refers to the increase in recoverable reserves from a discovered 
oil or gas field that occurs over the life of the field as it is appraised, developed and 
produced, is expected to be a major contributor to additions to reserves in the coming 
decades. It derives from three factors (Klett, 2004):
© OECD/IEA, 2008
210 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Geological  factors:     The  delineation  of  additional  reserves  through  new  seismic 
acquisition, appraisal drilling or the identification (using well-bore measurements), 
of reservoirs that had been previously bypassed.
Technological factors:    An increase in the share of oil in place that can be recovered 
through the application of new technologies, such as increased reservoir contact, 
improved secondary recovery and enhanced oil recovery.
Definitional factors:    Economic, logistical and political/regulatory/fiscal changes in 
the operating environment.
The Weyburn field in Canada provides a good illustration of how reserves can grow over 
time (Figure 9.8). Production started in the mid-1950s with conventional vertical wells. 
Initial proven reserves at that time were estimated at 260 million barrels. Infill drilling of 
wells in the mid-1980s added a producible wedge of 20 million barrels. Horizontal wells 
drilled in the 1990s added a second, additional wedge of reserves of around 60 million 
barrels. At the end of the 1990s, an enhanced oil recovery scheme — using anthropogenic 
CO 2  piped in from a coal-gasification plant in North Dakota in the United States — added 
120 million barrels more, or one-third, taking initial reserves to 460 million barrels.

The USGS has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the main factors in reserves 
growth, based on production series for 186 giant fields outside the United States (133 in 
OPEC countries) with more than 0.5 billion barrels of reserves for the period 1981 to 
2003 (Klett, 2004). Reserves in the OPEC fields increased by 80% in aggregate and in 
non-OPEC fields by around 30% over this period. 
Reserves  growth  in  any  given  field  automatically  raises  the  recovery  factor,  which 
is defined as total recoverable reserves (including the oil or gas already produced) 
expressed as a percentage share of the original hydrocarbons in place. As estimates 
of both the volume of hydrocarbons in place and how much is recoverable vary as a 
field is developed and produced, the estimated recovery factor inevitably fluctuates.

Chapter 9 - Turning oil resources into reserves 211

Consequently, estimating trends in recovery factors is extremely difficult. The global 
average recovery factor was recently estimated at 34.5%, based on IHS data (Schulte, 
2005).  Fields  containing  more  than  two-thirds  of  conventional  oil  reserves  have  a 
recovery factor of less than 40%. Lifting recovery factors could make a big difference to 
recoverable reserves, prolonging the production life of producing fields and postponing 
the peak of conventional oil production: a mere one percentage point increase in the 
average recovery factor would add more than 80 billion barrels (or 5% to 6%) to the 
world’s proven oil reserves (see Spotlight below). 
Enhanced  (or  tertiary)  oil  recovery  (EOR)  technologies  are  applied  to  increase  the 
amount of oil recovered from a reservoir beyond the range that primary and secondary 
recovery can generally achieve (generally between 20% and 50%). EOR is expected to 
contribute significantly to future reserves growth. The technologies utilised in EOR aim 
at altering the properties of the oil and improving its movement from the reservoir 
to the wellhead. EOR currently accounts for only about 3% of world oil production. 
There are three main types of EOR techniques in use today: thermal recovery, miscible 
displacement (using nitrogen, CO 2  or other hydrocarbons — natural gas in the case of 
EOR), and chemical flooding (with micellar-polymers or alkalines). Other technologies 
include microbial EOR and foam flooding.
Research and development on EOR technologies, especially those involving miscible 
displacement and CO 2  injection, which started before 1950, intensified after the first 
oil shock in the early 1970s. This effort, along with the development of expertise in 
candidate reservoir screening, EOR project implementation and field management, 
resulted in the deployment of many of the projects that are currently in operation 
today, most of which are in the United States. But low oil prices in the 1990s led to a 
significant loss of expertise amongst oil companies and technology providers. As a result, 
a renewed effort is needed to improve the prospects for expanding the deployment of 
EOR in the longer term, particularly in the following areas (NPC, 2007):
Monitoring and controlling the injection of CO   2 .
Complex multi-lateral wells with control of individual well-branch oil inflow.  
Optimisation of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).  
Reservoir-scale measurements, including 4-D seismic.  
Smart oil lifting, with re-injection of water in the same well.  
Additional  production  resulting  from  the  use  of  EOR  techniques  currently  amounts 
to about 2.5 mb/d, with reliance mainly on thermal processes (in the United States, 
Canada,  Venezuela,  Indonesia  and  China),  CO 2   injection  (United  States),  natural 
gas injection (Venezuela), nitrogen (in the Cantarell field in Mexico) and polymer/
surfactant  flooding  (China)  (Table  9.2).  In  the  Reference  Scenario,  additional 
production  resulting  from  EOR  techniques  (over  and  above  current  EOR  output)  is 
projected to rise to over 6 mb/d by 2030, with EOR using CO 2  (CO 2 -EOR) accounting for 
most of the increase (see Chapter 11). Worldwide, the prospects for CO 2 -EOR, which 
can be costly, have been boosted by higher oil prices (Box 9.5).

212 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
How soon – if ever – could oil recovery factors be raised to 50%?
A 2007 study by the US National Petroleum Council lists advances in technology 
that offer the potential to improve oil recovery factors. It estimates that the 
biggest  impact  would  come  from  technologies  that  maximise  the  effective 
reservoir  contact  between  the  well  bore  and  the  formation  through  various 
techniques, such as controlled multi-lateral drain holes, improvements in the 
efficiency  of  secondary  and  tertiary  recovery,  better  imaging  of  reservoirs 
and  production  management  in  real-time,  and  the  increased  use  of  4-D 
seismic  to  monitor  oil  flows,  and  “smart”  injector  and  producer  wells.  The 
commercialisation of some of those technologies may not happen until the end 
of next decade, but operators are already conducting full-field experiments that 
could advance the time scale. 
In the North Sea’s Norne field, the operator StatoilHydro has used new seismic 
acquisition and processing technologies, and combined them with geological 
and reservoir models and well-bore measurements to monitor fluid movements 
across the field (Boutte, 2007). These techniques helped to improve the planning 
of in-field drilling, to increase the field recovery factor from 40% to 52%, and to 
extend the life of the field to beyond 2015.  
Technologies that improve contact between the well bore and the reservoir 
show  great  promise.  In  Saudi  Arabia,  the  maximum  reservoir  contact  (MRC) 
approach, used in the development of the Shaybah field, demonstrated that well 
productivity could be increased significantly by drilling long horizontal and multi-
lateral wells. By increasing the length of well in contact with productive areas 
from 1 km to 12 km, through use of multi-lateral wells, well productivity was 
increased by a factor of six (Saleri et al., 2003). However, only a limited number 
of lateral branches can be extended from each mother bore and it is impossible 
to control the flow from individual sections. This can cause a problem as water 
production rises. Extreme reservoir contact (ERC), a concept being developed 
by Saudi Aramco, aims to get around this problem. ERC wells improve on MRC 
through the development and deployment of new intelligent well completions 
that  improve  recovery  by  means  of  downhole  monitoring  and  electrically 
activated downhole control valves, without the use of complex control lines 
that run from the wellhead. The ERC concept could allow an unlimited number 
of  lateral  branches  and  boost  the  recovery  from  heterogeneous  carbonate 
reservoirs. However, the widespread introduction of technologies like these that 
increase reservoir contact would require a significant increase in footage drilled, 
which would call for more drilling rigs and personnel — both of which are in short 
supply at present (see Chapter 13). 
It will probably take much more than two decades for the average recovery 
factor worldwide to be raised from about 35% today to 50%. Achieving this would 
boost world reserves by about 1.2 trillion barrels — equal to the whole of today’s 
proven reserves (Figure 9.3).

Carbon-dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO 2 -EOR) 
CO 2 -EOR, which involves the injection of CO 2  into oil reservoirs, is receiving increased 
attention because of the potential availability of CO 2  from anthropogenic sources and 
the environmental benefits of carbon sequestration. There are currently more than 
100 CO 2 -EOR projects in the world today, most of them in North America, producing 
300 kb/d of additional oil. In most cases, the CO 2  is extracted from produced natural 
gas. In the United States alone, the contribution from CO 2 -EOR has been projected 
to increase from the current level of 250 kb/d to 1.3 mb/d by 2030 (Caruso, 2007). 
The economics of CO 2 -EOR are attractive, as the injection of one tonne of CO 2  into a 
suitable reservoir leads to an incremental recovery of between two and three barrels of 
oil. The value of this oil could be set against the cost of capturing the CO 2  from power 
plants and transporting it to the injection fields, which is estimated to range from $50 
to $100 per tonne (IEA, 2008).
CO 2 -EOR was initially deployed in the 1970s and is still used only onshore, with a small 
inter-well distance. In addition to expanding the use of the technology to new onshore 
areas, there is considerable potential for using it offshore and in thicker reservoirs. 
An assessment of the potential in the United States shows that improved CO 2 -EOR, in 
combination with 4-D seismic, advanced well monitoring and control, and reservoir 
simulation, could add between 20 and 40 billion barrels of economically recoverable 
oil (ARI, 2006). The worldwide potential for CO 2 -EOR is of the order of 160 billion to 300 
billion barrels, equal to 7% to 14% of current remaining conventional recoverable oil 
resources. The Middle East and North America are thought to hold the greatest potential 
(Figure  9.9).  The  potential  is  greatest  in  fields  that  have  relatively  low  depletion 
levels, as the costs of installing the equipment and facilities required are onerous, 
particularly  for  offshore  fields  (Tzimas  et  al.,  2005).  Incremental  recovery  factors 
with EOR from offshore fields are expected to be lower than onshore fields because 
of different well configurations and reservoir contacts. CO 2 -EOR is now increasingly

Box 9.5  z   Deploying EOR: when, how and at what cost?
The applicability of EOR depends on the characteristics of the oilfield and its state 
of depletion. For a field that is conducive to EOR, there is generally a window of 
opportunity during which such technology is best applied. Table 9.3 shows the 
key criteria used for assessing the applicability of EOR technologies. The gravity 
of the crude oil is generally the first parameter considered: the majority of the 
miscible flooding techniques work only for light crudes. The second parameter is 
the amount of oil left in the field. CO 2 -EOR can be used when more than 20% of 
the oil is still recoverable. The oilfield temperature is the next variable: polymer 
flooding  (alkaline  and  micellar)  does  not  work  at  temperatures  over  95°C. 
Hydrocarbon, polymer and surfactant flooding have the greatest potential for 
increasing  recovery  factors.  Alberta’s  hydrocarbon  miscible  flooding  projects 
have achieved recovery factors of more than 70%. A massive polymer flooding 
project combined with surfactant addition in China’s Daqing complex has boosted 
production by 240 kb/d and the recovery factor by more than 12%. 
EOR costs have risen sharply in the last few years, in line with upstream costs 
generally.  Energy  feedstock  prices  for  thermal  processes  and  hydrocarbon 
displacement, increased demand for CO 2
, and the impact of higher oil prices 
on  surfactants  and  polymers  have  contributed  to  these  higher  costs.  On  the 
other hand, EOR costs are generally much lower than the cost of other means of 
reserves replacement, especially in North America. They range from less than 
$20 to $70 per incremental barrel of oil, excluding the cost offset that might be 
available through any CO 2  emission credit that might exist.

production life could be added to a number of North Sea fields, some are likely to be 
dropped from the list of potential candidates by 2010, due to less favourable miscible

Non-conventional oil resources
Extra-heavy oil and oil sands 
A large share of the world’s remaining oil resources is classified as non-conventional. 3  
These resources — oil sands, extra-heavy oil and oil shales — are generally more costly to 
produce, though considerable progress has been made in addressing technical challenges 
and lowering costs. Oil sands and extra-heavy oil resources in place worldwide amount 
to around 6 trillion barrels, of which between 1 and 2 trillion barrels may be ultimately 
recoverable economically. Technically recoverable reserves, defined by the World Energy 
Council as resources which can be exploited profitably with today’s technology, amount to 
some 1.1 trillion barrels using an average conservative recovery factor of 18% (Table 9.4).
The world’s extra-heavy oil and oil sands resources are largely concentrated in Canada 
(mainly  in  the  province  of  Alberta)  and  Venezuela  (in  the  Orinoco  Belt).  Assuming 
a  potential  20%  recovery  factor,  these  two  countries  would  hold  more  recoverable 
resources  than  all  the  conventional  reserves  in  the  Middle  East.  Alberta  alone  has 
proven  reserves  today  of  174  billion  barrels  (crude  bitumen)  and  an  estimated  315 
billion  barrels  of  ultimately  economically  recoverable  resources.  Nearly  80%  of  the

gas-to-liquids (GTL). Only the ﬁ rst four are considered here. The prospects for CTL and GTL are discussed 
in Chapter 11.

proven reserves in Alberta are in the Athabasca Wabiskaw McMurray deposit, while the 
remaining 20% are split between the Cold Lake Clearwater and the Peace River deposits. 
A one percentage-point increase in the recovery factor would boost recoverable resources 
by 60 billion barrels.

Several technologies exist to extract bitumen from oil sands. If the deposit is near 
the  surface,  oil  sands  are  mined,  using  enormous  power  shovels  and  dump  trucks. 
The  bitumen  is  then  extracted  using  hot  water  and  caustic  soda.  The  extracted 
bitumen needs to be upgraded (or diluted) with lighter hydrocarbons before it can 
be transported to a refinery. Upgrading consists of increasing the ratio of hydrogen 
to carbon, either by carbon removal (coking) or by adding hydrogen (hydrocracking), 
resulting in a synthetic crude oil that is shipped to a refinery. 
When the heavy hydrocarbon deposit is deeper, drilling is required. When its viscosity is 
low enough or can be reduced enough for the oil to flow to the surface, long horizontal 
or multi-lateral wells are used to maximise well bore contact with the reservoir and 
reduce the drop in pressure in the well bore. This is the technique used for several 
of  the  heavy  oil  deposits  in  Venezuela’s  Orinoco  Belt.  The  main  drawback  of  such 
conventional  production  techniques  is  the  low  recovery  factors,  typically  less  than 
15%. As a result, the expected amount of extra-heavy oil that could be recovered from 
the estimated 1 700 billion barrels in place in the Orinoco Belt is less than 250 billion 
barrels, using current technology. 
Much  higher  recovery  factors  (up  to  twice  those  of  conventional  production 
technologies)  can  be  obtained  using  in  situ  viscosity-reduction  techniques.  In  situ 
technologies  are  currently  used  for  highly  viscous  oils:  they  include  cyclic  steam  
stimulation injection (CSS) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Technologies 
being developed include a vapour extraction process, which uses hydrocarbon solvents 
instead  of  steam  to  increase  oil  mobility,  the  use  of  downhole  heaters  and  hybrid 
methods. Theoretical recovery factors of 50% to 70% are predicted for SAGD and new 
in situ processes, significantly higher than with CSS (20% to 35%). The steam-oil ratio is 
also lower with SAGD (2 to 3) than with CSS (3 to 5), so less water would be required. 
About 20% of Alberta’s bitumen can be mined, while 80% requires in situ recovery 
methods (ACR, 2004).

Oil shales: a technological milestone in sight?
Oil  shales  are  rocks  that  contain  a  large  proportion  of  solid  organic  compounds 
(kerogen) and are found at shallow depths, from surface outcrops to 1 000 metres 
below ground. Production of shale oil dates back to the 1830s and peaked worldwide 
in 1980 at around 45 000 tonnes. It fell to only 16 000 tonnes in 2004, with more than 
70% coming from Estonia. While resources in place are estimated at 2.5 to 3 trillion 
barrels, estimates of recoverable reserves vary markedly (see, for example, NPC, 2007 
and WEC, 2007). In calculating the long-term, oil-supply cost curve (see below) we have 
taken a figure of about 1 trillion barrels. The United States has the largest resources 
(more than 60% of the world total), followed by Brazil, Jordan, Morocco and Russia. Oil 
shales are not projected to make a significant contribution to world oil supply before 
2030, but technological breakthroughs could change this outlook.
Oil shales near the surface can be mined, with the mined rock heated in a process 
called retorting, which pyrolyses the kerogen into oil. Retort methods are unlikely to 
provide an environmentally sustainable production process. Deeper deposits require 
the use of techniques to enhance the productivity of the formation (such as hydraulic 
fracturing) and an in situ mobility-enhancement technology. The processes are very 
energy intensive. Retorting alone requires nearly 30% of the energy value of the oil 
produced. In addition, CO 2  emissions generated are in the range of 0.18 to 0.25 tonnes 
per  barrel  of  oil  produced.  Production  costs  currently  range  from  $50  to  $120  per 
barrel, disregarding any potential carbon permitting. 
The main US resource is the Green River Formation, with four basins in western states. 
Early experiments in the 1980s were halted due to the unfavourable economics and 
poor operational performance. Shell is assessing the technical and economic viability of 
an in situ conversion process, using down-hole heaters, at the Mahogany Ridge project 
(IEA, 2007). The oil produced has an API in the mid 30s, significantly higher than oil 
produced by surface retort. The process has the advantage of reducing the amount of land 
used, assuming wells can be drilled as little as 12 metres apart, but it requires the use 
of both water and of a sufficient amount of energy to heat and cool the relevant areas. 
A 100-kb/d unit would require 1.2 GW of power. Shell expects gas production from the 
produced fluid to meet most of the energy needs. Preliminary energy balances indicate, 
on a life-cycle assessment basis, a ratio of 3-4 to 1 between the energy generated and 
the energy used. Further technical developments to protect groundwater are required 
before going to a larger scale demonstration phase. Other companies, including Chevron, 
EGP and IEL, are testing different in situ processes. Shell is not expected to decide on 
whether or not to proceed with commercialisation of their technology before 2010. If it 
gets the green light, first production would occur after 2015.  
Long-term oil-supply cost curve
We have updated the oil-supply cost curve, which we first produced three years ago (IEA, 
2005), 4  based on the latest estimates of resource potential and the estimated range of 
4.  The IEA will be updating in 2009 the Resources to Reserves study, ﬁ rst published in 2005 (IEA, 2005), with 
an extended coverage of resources and technologies.

current costs of production. The curve plots the potential long-term contributions from 
conventional resources (including those defined above as conventional oil produced 
by  unconventional  means)  and  non-conventional  resources  (including  liquids  supply 
from coal and gas) against their associated current production costs (Figure 9.10). 
The  resource  potential  is  not  much  different  from  that  estimated  in  2005,  though 
technological developments have boosted the recovery potential for some categories 
of resources, notably ultra-deepwater, EOR and oil sands. But costs have been revised 
upwards significantly, reflecting the recent surge in costs (see Chapter 13).

Note: The curve shows the availability of oil resources as a function of the estimated production cost. Cost 
associated with CO 2  emissions is not included. There is also a signiﬁ cant uncertainty on oil shales production 
cost as the technology is not yet commercial. MENA is the Middle East and North Africa. The shading and 
overlapping of the gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids segments indicates the range of uncertainty surrounding 
the size of these resources, with 2.4 trillion shown as a best estimate of the likely total potential for the 
two combined.
The total long-term potential oil resource base alone is around 6.5 trillion barrels. 
Adding CTL and GTL increases this potential to about 9 trillion barrels. Of these totals, 
nearly 1.1 trillion barrels have already been produced at a cost of up to $30 per barrel 
in year-2008 dollars. 5  Remaining potentially economically recoverable resources are 
broken down as follows:
Conventional resources,    more than half of which are in the Middle East and North 
Africa, amount to about 2.1 trillion barrels (based on the latest USGS assessments). 
The cost of exploiting these resources is expected to be much lower on average than 
the cost of all other sources of supply, with the exception of oil recovered using 
CO 2 -EOR.  The  cost  of  exploiting  conventional  resources  (excluding  taxes  and 
royalties) typically ranges from less than $10 to $40 per barrel, though some fall 
outside this range.

North American ﬁ elds.

Additional resources recovered using enhanced oil recovery    has been split according 
to the use CO 2 -EOR and other EOR technologies. The cost of CO 2 -EOR ranges from 
just over $20 per barrel to about $70, compared with about $30 to $80 for other 
types of EOR. The overall potential from EOR is estimated at between 400 and 500 
billion barrels, on the assumption that the introduction of new EOR technologies is 
accelerated, lowering unit costs.
Deepwater and ultra-deepwater    resources could deliver over 160 billion barrels at 
a cost of up to $65 per barrel.
Arctic resources    could amount to 90 billion barrels at a cost of between $40 and 
$100 per barrel.
Extra-heavy oil    and oil sands resources total more than 1 trillion barrels and could 
be produced at costs ranging from over $40 to about $80 per barrel.
Oil shales    production costs are estimated to be in the range of $50 to well over 
$100 per barrel. Because of a lack of major commercial projects, the prospects for 
improving oil shales production technology are very uncertain. Consequently, we do 
not expect oil shales to make any significant contribution to world oil supply before 
2030. Moreover, a carbon penalty would increase significantly the production cost, 
as oil shales extraction is extremely energy and carbon intensive.
CTL     and  GTL  have  a  large  potential  (see  also  Chapter  11),  but  they  will  be  in 
competition for their feedstock with other potential applications (mainly in power 
generation and final uses).  Their costs range from $40 to $120 per barrel at current 
feedstock prices. 
Political, environmental, regulatory and fiscal factors will strongly influence the extent 
to which this potential is exploited and the costs to oil companies of bringing the 
resources to market. Production of non-conventional resources, in particular oil sands 
as well as oil shales in the future, leaves a large environmental footprint, including 
through  the  greenhouse  gases  emitted  in  the  production  and  use.  The  widespread 
introduction of CO 2  emission-reduction incentives would have a major impact on the 
cost curve, as non-conventional oil would become relatively more expensive and CO 2 -
EOR potentially cheaper. Technological developments will also continue to change the 
shape and position of the curve.

Chapter 10 - Field-by-field analysis of oil production 221
CHAPTER 10
FIELD-BY-FIELD ANALYSIS OF OIL PRODUCTION
Is decline accelerating?
The future rate of decline in output from producing oilfields as they mature is a   z
critical determinant of the amount of new capacity and investment that will be 
needed globally to meet projected demand. A detailed field-by-field analysis of 
historical production trends reveals that the size of reserves and physiographic 
situation (onshore/offshore) are the main factors in explaining the shape of an 
oilfield’s production profile. The larger the reserves, the lower the peak relative 
to reserves and the slower the decline once a field has come off plateau. Rates 
are also lower for onshore than offshore (especially deepwater) fields. 
Based  on  data  for  580  of  the  world’s  largest  fields  that  have  passed  their   z
production  peak,  the  observed  decline  rate  —  averaged  across  all  fields  and 
weighted by their production over their whole lives — is 5.1%. Decline rates are 
lowest for the biggest fields: they average 3.4% for super-giant fields, 6.5% for 
giant fields and 10.4% for large fields. The average rate of observed post-plateau 
decline, based on our data sub-set of 479 fields, is 5.8%. 
Observed decline rates vary markedly by region. Post-peak and post-plateau rates   z
are lowest in the Middle East and highest in the North Sea. This reflects, to a large 
extent, differences in the average size of fields, which in turn is related to the 
extent to which overall reserves are depleted and their physiographic location. In 
general, observed decline rates are also higher the younger the field, mainly because 
these fields tend to be smaller and are more often found offshore. Investment and 
production policies also affect decline rates, especially in OPEC countries. 
The average size of the fields analysed is significantly larger than that of all the   z
fields in the world, as our database contains all the super-giant fields and most of 
the giant fields. The decline rates for the fields not included in our dataset are, 
on average, likely to be at least as high as for the large fields in our database. 
On  this  basis,  we  estimate  that  the  average  production-weighted  observed 
decline rate worldwide is 6.7% for post-peak fields.   
The average annual   z natural, or underlying, decline rate for the world as a whole 
— stripping out the effects of ongoing and periodic investment — is estimated at 
9% for post-peak fields. In other words, the decline in production from existing 
fields  would  have  been  around  one-third  faster  had  there  been  no  capital 
spending on those fields once they had passed their peak. 
Our Reference Scenario projections imply a one percentage-point increase in the   z
global average natural decline rate to over 10% per year by 2030 as all regions 
experience a drop in average field size and most see a shift in production to 
offshore fields. This means that total upstream investment in some countries will 
need to rise, in some cases significantly, just to offset decline.

222 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Understanding production patterns and trends
An understanding of oilfield production profiles and the impact of various geological 
and economic variables on the shape of production curves is critically important to 
projecting future output from fields already in production or from fields that are yet 
to be brought into production. A major finding of past Outlooks is that the future rate 
of production decline from producing fields aggregated across all regions is the single 
most important determinant of the amount of new capacity that needs to be added 
and  the  need  to  invest  in  developing  new  fields  (see,  in  particular,  IEA,  2001  and 
2003). In other words, future supply is far more sensitive to decline rates than to the 
rate of growth in oil demand. 1  Most investment over the projection period will actually 
be needed to offset the loss of capacity from existing fields as they mature, oilfield 
pressure declines and — in the absence of new investment — well flow-rates fall (see 
Chapter 13 for a detailed analysis of investment trends). 
For  these  reasons,  we  have  undertaken  a  detailed  study  of  historical  oilfield 
production trends, using extensive field-by-field data, with a view to achieving a 
better understanding of the drivers of decline rates, how they could develop in the 
future and what that will mean for investment. The results of this study were used 
to model future production levels to 2030, the results of which are set out in detail 
in Chapter 11. 
The  field-by-field  study  involved  building  a  large  database  containing  the  full 
production history and a range of technical parameters for around 800 of the largest 
individual oilfields in the world. The database includes, to the best of our knowledge, 
all  the  super-giant  fields,  containing  initial  proven  and  probable  (2P)  reserves 2  
exceeding 5 billion barrels; virtually all giant fields, containing more than 500 million 
barrels, in production today; and the bulk of the world’s large fields, containing at least 
100 million barrels. Together, these fields account for close to three-quarters of all the 
initial reserves of all the fields ever discovered worldwide and more than two-thirds of 
all the crude oil produced globally in 2007 (see Box 10.1 for more details). We believe 
that this is the most comprehensive study of field-by-field oil production patterns and 
trends ever made public. 3  We intend to extend and refine this work in the future.
The majority of the fields that have ever been found worldwide have already been 
brought into production. The share is highest for the biggest fields, both in terms of 
their number and their overall reserves, mainly because all but a handful of them were 
discovered several decades ago. Out of an estimated 58 super-giant fields that have 
been found, all but four 4  are already in production; out of close to 400 giant fields that 
we have identified, around 80 are either being developed, waiting to be developed

or are temporarily shut in. 5  The combined initial 2P reserves of all super-giant and 
giant fields amount to 1 306 billion barrels, of which an estimated 697 billion barrels 
remain (equal to about half of the world’s remaining reserves of conventional oil — 
see Chapter 9). In total, an estimated 79% of the world’s remaining conventional oil 
reserves are contained in fields that are already being exploited. Thus, the outlook for 
production at these fields is critical to world oil supply in the short to medium term.
What do rising decline rates mean for oil production 
and investment?
The  production  profile  of  an  oilfield  reflects  a  number  of  different  factors, 
including the techniques used to extract its reserves, the field-development 
programme,  reservoir  management  practices,  geology,  national  production 
policies, field-maintenance programmes and external factors, such as strikes 
and  military  geopolitical  conflicts.  The  analysis  presented  below  points  to  a 
long-term trend towards higher faster decline rates once oilfields have reached 
their peak, as a result of a shift in the pattern of fields that will be brought on 
stream in the future. In particular, a growing share of production is expected to 
come from smaller fields and, in the medium term, from fields located offshore, 
which tend to decline much more quickly than big, onshore fields because of 
the way they are developed. This is, in turn, largely a function of technical and 
economic factors rather than geology. Faster decline rates go hand-in-hand with 
higher peak-production levels relative to reserves.
Rising  decline  rates  have  important  implications  for  development  costs  and 
investment needs. In general, the smaller a field, the more expensive it is to 
develop (and operate), expressed in dollars per barrel per day of capacity and, 
especially, per barrel of oil produced. Similarly, costs are typically significantly 
higher  for  offshore  fields,  particularly  in  deep  water.  Over  the  projection 
period, all regions continue to experience a drop in average field size and most 
see a shift in production to offshore fields as the biggest fields, which are usually 
found and developed first, decline. This means that total upstream investment 
in some countries will need to rise, in some cases significantly, just to offset 
decline (even though total world investment needs are expected to drop, as the  
share of the lowest-cost producing regions in total production increases). The 
biggest increases are needed in OPEC countries. It is far from certain that all the 
required investment will be forthcoming, given the size of these investments 
and potential barriers (see Chapter 13) — because of so-called “above-ground” 
factors and not because of geology. These factors are discussed in detail in the 
next four chapters.

224 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Current estimates of reserves are derived from the latest estimates of the oil initially 
in place and the share that can be economically recovered. Yet that share, as well 
as the rate at which that share can be produced, are far from certain, as the precise 
behaviour of a given field or reservoir is exceedingly difficult to predict. Moreover, 
the  deployment  of  new  production  technologies  (including  secondary  and  enhanced 
recovery techniques) can push up ultimate recovery rates and production levels. Careful 
analysis of these factors is vital to predicting future recovery and decline rates and, 
therefore, production.
Box 10.1  z  The IEA field-by-field oil production database
The  IEA  has  compiled  a  database  containing  the  full  crude  oil  production 
history  and  a  range  of  key  technical  parameters  for  a  total  of  798  oilfields 
worldwide.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  the  database  includes  all  of  the 
world’s 54 super-giant fields that have ever produced, as well as the bulk of 
the giant producing fields (263 out of a total of around 320). 6  Of the remaining 
481 fields, 285 are large fields, representing at least half of all the fields in 
this category in the world and most of the largest ones. The rest of the fields 
are small fields, containing between 50 and 100 million barrels. The choice of 
which large and small fields to include in the database was partly driven by 
data availability. Nonetheless, we believe that the dataset for large fields is 
reasonably representative of the actual geographic distribution of all such fields 
in production worldwide today. 
For all producing fields, data was compiled on annual oil production over the 
full life of the field, initial and remaining proven and probable (2P) recoverable 
reserves, the volume of oil initially in place, lithology (the geological formation of 
the field), physiographic location (onshore, offshore and shallow/deep water) and 
the discovery date. For some fields, additional information on reservoir porosity 
and thickness, as well as the deployment of improved recovery techniques, was 
also obtained. 
The field-by-field data were compiled from a range of different sources. The 
primary  source  of  data  on  production  and  reserves  was  IHS,  without  whose 
assistance we would not have been able to carry out this work. Deloitte & Touche 
Petroleum Services also provided data on a number of fields. The US Geological 
Survey and the US Energy Information Administration supplied data for some US 
fields. Other sources include official statistics, published by the governments of 
oil-producing  countries,  international  and  national  oil  companies,  oil  services 
companies  and  consulting  firms.  These  organisations  assisted  us  in  validating 
and checking the consistency and veracity of the data, as well as in verifying the 
results of our analysis. We gratefully acknowledge their contribution.

The importance of size
There  are  currently  about  70  000  oilfields  in  production  worldwide.  The  bulk  of 
crude oil production comes from a small number of very prolific fields, mostly super-
giants and giants. 7  Output at the world’s ten largest producing oilfields totalled just 
over  14  million  barrels  per  day  (mb/d)  in  2007  (Table  10.1),  contributing  20%  of 
world conventional production. The 20 largest fields produced 19.2 mb/d, or over a 
quarter of world production. One field alone — Ghawar in Saudi Arabia — produced 
5.1 mb/d, equal to 7% of world conventional oil production (see the next section).

Four of the other fields are also in Saudi Arabia and eight others in other Middle 
Eastern countries (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates). Output in 2007 
at 16 of the 20 largest fields was below their historic peaks. Production has fallen 
most in percentage terms at Samotlor in Russia. All of the 20 largest producing fields 
are super-giants, of which Ghawar, with 140 billion barrels of initial reserves, is by 
far the largest.
Most of the world’s largest fields — by production and reserves — have been in 
production  for  many  years,  in  some  cases  for  several  decades.  The  last  of  the 
top  20  producing  fields  to  be  discovered  was  Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli  in  1985. 
Priobskoye in Russia was found in 1982, Canterell in Mexico in 1977, and all the 
others between 1928 and 1968. In 2007, five fields produced more than 1 mb/d 
and  another  eight  more  than  500  thousand  barrels  per  day  (kb/d).  They  make 
up one-quarter of world crude oil production. Around 110 fields in total produce 
more than 100 kb/d each. Collectively, they account for just over 50% of world 
production. A very large number of small fields, each producing less than 100 kb/d 
at present — approximately 70 000 in total — produce just under half of world 
production.

The world’s oil supplies remain very dependent on output from big, old fields. 
Despite the fact that many of them have been in production for decades, output 
from  super-giant  and  giant  fields  (holding  more  than  500  million  barrels  of 
initial reserves) has actually grown significantly over the past two decades. The 
share  in  world  production  of  all  the  super-giant  fields  and  those  giant  fields 
included  in  our  database  rose  from  56%  in  1985  to  60%  in  2007.  Surprisingly, 
fields  that  came  into  production  before  the  1970s  still  make  the  largest 
contribution,  amounting  to  just  over  24  mb/d  in  2007  —  equal  to  35%  of  the 
world total (Figure 10.1). Indeed, output from these fields has gradually risen 
since the mid-1980s (it fell sharply in the early 1980s, mainly because of OPEC 
policies).  Only  five  super-giant  or  giant  fields  began  producing  in  the  current 
decade — Ourhoud in Algeria, Grane in Norway, Girassol in Angola, Jubarte in 
Brazil and Xifeng in the Gansu province of China — and made up a mere 2% of 
total output from such fields and little more than 1% of world output in 2007.

Regional differences
Big  oilfields  are  unevenly  distributed  across  the  world;  their  share  in  overall 
production  and  their  average  size  vary  markedly  across  regions.  The  Middle  East 
is  characterised  by  a  large  number  of  super-giant  and  giant  fields.  With  9  billion 
barrels of initial reserves, their average size is the highest of any region (Table 10.3).

The region holds a quarter of all super-giant and giant fields. Around three-quarters 
of the world’s super-giant and giant fields are located onshore (including fields that 
straddle land and sea). The share is highest in the Middle East, Asia and the former 
Soviet Union. In Europe, all big fields are located offshore. Super-giant and giant fields 
account for the largest share of production in the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian 
region (Eastern Europe/Eurasia) and Latin America (Figure 10.2). Their share is lowest 
in Asia, Europe and the Pacific region. Although North America accounts for just over 
a quarter of all the crude oil ever produced in the world and 13% of current output, 
there are little more than 50 super-giant and giant fields in that region — a far smaller 
number relative to output than in any other region. 8

There are also big differences, according to their geographic location and their size, 
in the extent to which reserves have been depleted. Among all fields in production 
today,  the  depletion  factor  —  the  share  of  initial  reserves  that  has  already  been 
produced — is marginally higher for the super-giant and giant fields. Worldwide, those 
fields are on average 48% depleted (weighted by total production), compared with 
47% for other fields included in our study (Table 10.4). Depletion factors are highest 
for  North  America,  where  most  fields  have  been  in  production  for  decades,  and 
Europe, where small fields dominate production. They are lowest in the Middle East.
8.  The highly fragmented ownership of North American ﬁ elds means that many large formations are broken 
down statistically into separate ﬁ elds, resulting in a smaller number of giants.

Oilfield production profiles and characteristics
Every  oilfield  follows  a  unique  production  profile,  according  to  the  natural 
characteristics of the reservoirs within it, the manner in which it is developed and 
production-management policies. Typically, an oilfield goes through a build-up phase, 
during which production rises as newly drilled wells are brought into production, a 
period of plateau production, during which output typically is broadly flat as new wells 
are brought on stream offsetting declines at the oldest producing wells, and a decline 
phase, during which production gradually falls with reservoir pressure. 
In practice, oilfields rarely follow a smooth, predictable production path. Commercial 
and policy considerations affect how a field is developed. And reservoirs behave in 
different ways at different stages of depletion for geological and technical reasons. In 
addition, production rates can fluctuate sharply as new phases of a field’s development 
are launched, often to combat the “natural” or underlying decline in output. In general, 
with larger fields, the build-up period is long and development is pursued in phases. 
Some fields can build up over several decades: the Zakum field in the United Arab 
Emirates, for example, began producing in 1967 and hit record output of 790 kb/d only 
in 2002 — a level that is expected to be exceeded in the future. Periodic maintenance 
programmes (scheduled and unplanned) and deliberate shut-ins for policy reasons (for 
example, to comply with national production quotas) can also upset the underlying 
trend in production.   
Standard production profiles
Distinguishing the impact of the inherent technical characteristics of specific types 
of fields from the effect of how those fields are developed and managed over time 
is  crucial  to  understanding  historic  production  trends  and  assessing  the  long-term 
prospects for output — both for fields that are already producing and those that are 
yet to be developed. For this reason, we have identified standard production profiles 
for different types of oilfields and assessed how those profiles differ according to a 
number of technical variables. This analysis is based on a sample of 725 fields from our 
oilfield database, with an average production history of just under 22 years and total 
initial reserves of 1 358 billion barrels (Table 10.5) The oldest field, Balahani-Sabunchi-

Ramani in Azerbaijan, started producing in 1871. The full dataset could not be used, 
because of a lack of data on certain technical parameters. Nonetheless, almost all 
super-giant and giant fields are included, together with most large fields.

The analysis revealed that the size of reserves and the physiographic situation (onshore/
offshore) are the most important variables in explaining the shape of the production 
profiles (Box 10.2). Lithology — essentially whether the field is carbonate or sandstone — 
does not appear to influence to a significant degree the shape of the production profile, 
everything else being equal. The results show that small fields reach their peak sooner, 
produce a higher share of initial reserves by peak and decline more rapidly than large 
fields (Table 10.6 and Figure 10.3). It takes about twice as long for big fields to get 
to peak. Everything else being equal, peak production relative to reserves at offshore 
(shelf)  fields  is  higher  than  at  onshore  fields,  reflecting  the  need  for  developers  to 
recover more quickly the higher costs usually associated with offshore fields. Deepwater 
fields, although usually big, behave in a similar way to small offshore fields with peak 
production reached after five years. On average, 7% of reserves are produced in that 
year, with cumulative production reaching 22% of reserves. The production curve for 
deepwater fields is, thus, highly skewed to the left, with less than a quarter of reserves 
produced in the relatively brief pre-peak period. Generally, offshore fields tend to have 
fewer wells but more highly productive horizontal wells. Spacing between wells is also 
much wider for offshore fields, because of the higher cost of drilling wells.
The notional average productive life of each category of field (on the assumption that 
cumulative production equals total initial reserves when the field is abandoned) differs 
markedly, from 27 years for deepwater fields to 110 years for fields holding more than 
1.5 billion barrels. In practice, however, the tail of production at mature fields is strongly 
influenced  by  the  prevailing  economic  conditions.  The  water  cut  (the  share  of  water 
contained in the mixture of hydrocarbons and water that flows from the well) tends to rise 
towards the end of a field’s life, pushing up processing costs. For as long as total operating 
costs are below the market value of the oil recovered, production can be sustained at 
relatively low levels for a long time. Since the behaviour of heavily depleted fields varies, 
the estimates presented here should be considered indicative only.

Box 10.2  z  Oilfield production-profiling methodology 
The  analysis  of  oilfield  production  profiles  seeks  to  explain  the  shape  of 
standardised profiles according to a number of technical variables, namely: 
Total crude oil reserves.  z
Physiographic situation (onshore, shallow offshore and deep water).  z
Lithology (carbonate, sandstone and chalk).  z
Permeability,  thickness  and  porosity  of  the  reservoir  and  the  API  gravity   z
of the liquids present (for fields holding initial reserves of at least 1 billion 
barrels). These parameters were amalgamated into a single indicator of the 
transmissibility of the fluid in the reservoir rock, by multiplying permeability 
and thickness with each other and dividing the result by gravity. 
The analysis revealed that the size of reserves and the physiographic situation 
were the most important variables in determining the shape of the production 
profile.  Therefore,  normalised  production  curves  (plotting  annual  production 
against cumulative production, both expressed as the share of initial 2P reserves) 
were first estimated according to the size of reserves for three categories: over 
1.5 billion barrels; between 500 million and 1.5 billion barrels; and less than 
500 million barrels. Using statistical techniques, the degree of influence of the 
other technical variables in explaining the shape of the normalised production 
curves was then estimated. 9  The results were used to produce mean normalised 
curves  for  each  size  category  of  field  according  to  different  variants  of  the 
technical variables. The mean curves were then extended to show how each 
category  of  field  would  be  expected  to  behave  through  to  full  depletion  of 
reserves. This was done by assuming an exponential rate of change.

Focus on giant fields
We  extended  further  the  analysis  of  the  oil-production  profiles  of  super-giant 
fields and those giants in our sample holding initial reserves of more than 1 billion 
barrels. For these fields, we collected additional data on porosity, permeability 
and thickness of reservoirs, as well as the gravity of the oil, to test the influence 
of  these  factors  on  the  shape  of  the  standard  production  profiles.  The  results 
show that the size of the field is still the dominant variable, with transmissibility 
(permeability and viscosity) playing a less important role. Porosity and lithology do 
not seem to have any influence. 
We  identified  distinct  differences  in  the  standard  profiles  for  fields  holding 
between 1 and 2.8 billion barrels and those holding more than 2.8 billion barrels. 
For the first set of fields, transmissibility is a more important determinant of the 
shape of the production profile than the physiographic situation of the field. Those 
fields with high transmissibility tend to reach a higher plateau sooner and to be 
produced more rapidly: 68% of reserves are produced after about 30 years, while 
the corresponding figure for low transmissibility fields is only 57% (Figure 10.4). 
The  impact  of  all  technical  variables  other  than  the  size  of  reserves  on  the 
production profile of fields holding more than 2.8 billion barrels was not found to 
be statistically significant. This may be explained by the influence of non-technical 
factors, such as production quotas and geopolitical factors, especially in the Middle 
East, where many of the largest fields are found. In addition, the development of 
large fields tends to occur in phases, according to long-term technical, economic 
and political objectives. As a result, they are less likely to conform to standard 
profiles.

Changes in production profiles over time
The  standard  production  profiles  for  the  six  categories  of  field  analysed  above 
(Figure 10.3) are derived from production data for fields that came into production 
at different times over several  decades. Three-quarters of the fields with reserves 
of more than 1.5 billion barrels in this dataset started to produce in the 1970s or 
earlier.  More  than  60%  of  medium-sized  fields,  both  onshore  and  offshore,  also 
started producing in the same period. The smallest fields were generally developed 
later: half of small onshore fields and more than three-quarters of small offshore 
fields started to produce in the last 15 years.
Analysis of production profiles by vintage shows that fields developed in recent years 
tend to build up more quickly to a higher plateau (relative to reserves), maintained 
over a shorter period of time, than fields developed before the 1990s. For example, 
Hassi Berkine Sud, a medium-sized Algerian field brought into production in 1998, 
recently reached plateau production equal to around 6% of reserves compared with a 
typical peak of little more than 2% for all onshore fields of similar size in our dataset 
(Figure  10.5).  This  finding  is  not  particularly  surprising:  advances  in  production 
technology have made it financially attractive to introduce improved and enhanced 
recovery techniques earlier in a field’s life. In addition, the pressure from investors 
on  private  companies  to  minimise  the  payback  period  and  so  maximise  the  net 
present value of future cash-flow, has increased in recent years. 
Measuring observed production decline rates
Approach and definitions
While each phase of an oilfield’s life is important, the rate at which production from 
oilfields declines once it has reached peak production is critical to determining the

need  for  additional  capacity,  either  through  further  development  work  at  existing 
fields or by bringing new fields into production. At a global level, the faster the rate of 
decline, the greater the need for additional capacity for a given level of demand. The 
actual rate of decline, how it has changed and how it could evolve in the years to come 
have assumed enormous importance in the current debate about the medium- and 
long-term prospects for oil supply. For this reason, we have carried out an in-depth, 
field-by-field analysis of decline rates in order to improve understanding about the 
topic and gain insights into future production trends.

Discussions about decline rates are often confused by a failure to make clear what is 
meant by the term and exactly how they are calculated. It is important to understand 
that, at any given moment, some oilfields will be ramping up to peak production, others 
will be at peak or plateau, and others will be in decline. Averaging rates across a group 
of  fields  does  not,  therefore,  reveal  by  itself  any  clear  information  on  the  decline 
rate of fields at different stages of their production life. Only a field-by-field analysis 
of production trends can shed light on this. In this section, we use our field-by-field 
database to quantify decline rates in detail and analyse long-term trends. The subsequent 
section looks at how decline rates could evolve over the projection period. The precise 
definitions and methods used to measure decline rates are described in Box 10.3.
Of a total of 798 producing fields in our field-by-field database, we prepared a dataset 
of 651 fields with initial reserves of at least 50 million barrels in order to carry out 
our analysis of decline rates. Of this set, 580 fields were found to have passed peak 
production  (Table  10.7).  In  other  words,  for  each  of  these  fields,  production  over 
the latest year of production is below the maximum level ever achieved in any one 
year. These fields produced a total of 40.5 mb/d in 2007, or 58% of world crude oil 
production. Their initial reserves total 1 241 billion barrels, equal to 52% of the world 
total. Of the post-peak fields, a total of 479 were found to be in the post-plateau 
phase. Of these, 362 fields are in decline phase 3 (with annual production at less than

Box 10.3  z  How do we define and calculate decline rates?
Peak production is the highest level of production recorded over a single year 
at a given field. 
An oil field is in decline when aggregate production in the latest year (2007 
for most fields in the dataset used for this analysis) is below production in the 
peak year, even if the field attains other lower peaks in the interim.  Plateau 
production  is  when  annual  production  is  more  than  85%  of  peak  production. 
A field is in the post-plateau phase when it has fallen below plateau. For the 
purposes  of  our  decline  rates  calculations,  only  fields  with  production  in  the 
last year of production that is below the level of the first year of post-plateau 
production are included. 
The full period of production decline after peak is broken down into three distinct 
phases for the purposes of measurement: decline phase 1 is the period from peak 
annual production to the last year of plateau production; decline phase 2 is from 
the first year at which production falls below plateau through to the last year in 
which production is above 50% of peak; and decline phase 3 is the period after 
which production is consistently below 50% of peak. 
The  observed  decline  rate  is  the  cumulative  average  annual  rate  of  change 
in observed production between two given years (for example, between peak 
production and the latest year).
The natural decline rate, sometimes called the underlying decline rate, is the 
notional rate of decline in production between two given years had there been 
no investment beyond that associated with the initial development of the field. 
The methodology used to estimate this rate by region is described in Figure 10.9 
below.
Unless otherwise mentioned, all the decline rates referred to in this chapter are 
production-weighted. In other words, the average for a particular group of fields 
(by type or region) takes into account the level of production of each field in the 
total. Cumulative production over the full life of the field was used to weight 
decline rates for fields currently in production and in the post-peak phase.
Generally,  historical  observed  decline  rates  were  calculated  using  the  full 
production history of each field. Of course, these vary greatly in length: the 
oldest field in our dataset has been producing for 137 years and the youngest for 
two years (the minimum period for which calculating a decline rate is possible). 
Solely for the purposes of measuring long-term trends, decline rates were also 
calculated on a year-by-year basis, with the decline rates for each field weighted 
by the actual production in the given year. 
half that at peak). A larger share of super-giant fields are in the post-plateau phase, 
as  most  of  them  have  been  in  production  for  several  decades.  Nonetheless,  the 
world’s biggest field by far — Ghawar — is not among the post-plateau fields, as 
production in 2007 was still less than 15% below the peak of 5.6 mb/d reached in 
1980 (Box 10.4).

Results of the analysis
The observed post-peak decline rate averaged across all fields on a production-weighted 
basis is 5.1% using raw data. That is equal to 3.6 mb/d per year, based on the 2007 level 
of global crude oil production. As the standard production profiles suggest, decline 
rates are lowest for the biggest fields: they average 3.4% for super-giant fields, 6.5% 
for giant fields and 10.4% for large fields (Table 10.8). Rates are also lowest for onshore 
fields and highest for deepwater offshore fields, reflecting the different ways in which 
they  are  developed  (as  described  in  the  previous  section).  On  average  worldwide, 
production has declined yearly by 4.3% at onshore fields and 7.3% at offshore fields, 
with deepwater fields declining by 13.3%. Sandstone fields have declined significantly 
faster than carbonate fields, 6.3% versus 3.4%, but this largely reflects the fact that 
the latter tend to be much larger and are more often located in the Middle East (where 
decline rates have been tempered by historically conservative production policies);

Box 10.4  z  The Ghawar field: the super-giant among super-giants  
The Ghawar field — the world’s largest — was discovered in 1948 and started 
producing in 1951. The area of the field — more accurately described as a 
collection  of  oil-bearing  formations  —  is  partitioned  into  six  geographical 
areas, from north to south: Ain Dar, Shedgum, Farzan, Hawiyah, Uthmaniyah 
and  Haradh.  Oil  is  produced  from  the  Jurassic  formations,  namely  Arab, 
Dhruma  and Hanifa, while gas and condensate are extracted from the deeper 
and  older  reservoirs,  in  the  Khuff,  Unayzah  and  Jawf  formations.  Ghawar 
crude, which has an average gravity of around 34° API and sulphur content of 
1.8%, accounts for most of the Saudi Arab Light export blend.
Ghawar is a large anticline structure, 280 km long by 25 km wide, with about 
50 metres of net oil pay. Initial oil in place is 250 billion barrels, of which 
initial  recoverable  reserves  are  estimated  at  140  billion  barrels  (implying 
an expected ultimate recovery rate of 56%). Cumulative production reached 
66 billion barrels in 2007, so remaining reserves are about 74 billion barrels. 
Ghawar  produced  5.1 mb/d  of  crude  oil  in  2007,  down  from  a  peak  of 
5.6 mb/d in 1980 (when the  field’s capacity was fully utilised in response to 
the loss of Iranian production following the revolution) and a recent peak of 
5.3 mb/d in 1997. The observed post-peak decline rate is, thus, a mere 0.3% 
per year. Ghawar is still at the plateau phase of production on our definition 
(Box 10.3).
Reservoir pressure is maintained through the use of peripheral water flooding, 
whereby seawater is injected into the reservoir in the oil layer just above the 
tar mat that separates the oil layer from the aquifer. The water pushes the oil 
inwards and upwards, towards the producing wells. This secondary recovery 
technique, first used at Ghawar in 1965, typically results in lower flow rates 
than the more commonly used pattern water flooding, but tends to result in 
a higher recovery rate and allows for plateau production to be maintained for 
longer (see IEA, 2005 for more details). Nonetheless, as the field has matured, 
maintaining  reservoir  pressure  and  sustaining  production  has  become  more 
difficult and costs have risen. The water cut — the share of water in the liquids 
extracted — increased sharply in the 1990s, reaching 37% in 2000. However, 
recent development work has succeeded in reducing the water cut to 27% at 
present, according to Saudi Aramco, the field operator. 
Ghawar has been developed in distinct stages, which have progressively raised 
the field’s capacity and kept the field at plateau. The most recent project, 
involving the Haradh area in the southern part of the field, was completed 
in 2006, tripling capacity there to about 900 kb/d. This has helped to offset 
natural declines in other parts of the field. The overall capacity of Ghawar 
is sustained by infill drilling and well work-overs to maintain flow pressure 
in  various  parts  of  the  field.  Reports  suggest  that  enhanced  oil  recovery 
techniques  are  being  used  to  boost  capacity  in  the  mature  zones  of  the 
Shedgum and Uthmaniyah areas, where extensive drilling programmes have 
recently been undertaken (Sanford Bernstein, 2007).

 lithology does not appear to be a major determinant of decline rates (see the previous 
section). Regardless of location or lithology, decline rates are, in most cases, lower the 
bigger the field. Similarly, the rates of post-plateau decline are usually slightly higher 
than the rate of post-peak decline, confirming the results of the production-profiling 
analysis (Figure 10.6). 10  Worldwide, the average rate of observed post-plateau decline 
is 5.8% for the 479 fields that are in the post-plateau decline phase out of the 580 post-
peak fields and the total of 798 fields in our database. 11

Decline rates also vary markedly by region. Rates are lowest in the Middle East 
and  highest  in  the  North  Sea  (Table  10.9).  This  reflects,  to  a  large  extent, 
differences in the average size of fields, which in turn is related to  the  extent 
to  which  reserves  are  depleted  and  their  location  onshore  or  offshore.  North 
Sea  fields  tend  to  be  much  smaller  than  Middle  East  fields,  while  almost  all 
significant  North  Sea  fields  are  located  offshore.  North  Sea  fields  (which  make 
up all the European fields in our dataset) have declined on average by 11.5% per 
year since peak and 13.3% since plateau. The relatively low decline rates of Middle 
East fields, which have averaged less than 3% per year, is also explained by the
10.  The  average  post-peak  decline  rates  calculated  using  the  standard  production  proﬁ les  for  different 
categories of ﬁ eld by size are, unsurprisingly, of a similar magnitude to the rates calculated using raw data 
that are presented in this section.
11.  The observed decline rates shown in this chapter differ from those for non-OPEC countries described 
in the IEA’s most recent Medium-Term Oil Market Report, published in July (IEA, 2008). This is because of 
methodological differences, associated with the different time horizons of the two reports. The MTOMR 
estimates decline rates on a year-by-year basis, rather than over the full production life of the ﬁ eld. The 
MTOMR also adjusts raw ﬁ eld-by-ﬁ eld production data for temporary reductions in output caused by  unex-
pected events such as weather-related outages, strikes and security-related disruptions. Nonetheless, the 
results are similar.

disruptions to the standard production profile caused by short-term production-
management policies (notably in support of OPEC targets) and geopolitical conflicts. 
The dominance of Middle East countries and the heavy weight of super-giant fields 
in the population of OPEC fields contribute to the much lower average post-peak 
decline rates for OPEC compared with non-OPEC countries.

The impact of field age and maturity
In  general,  observed  decline  rates  are  higher  the  younger  the  field.  For  example,  the 
average decline rate for all the non-OPEC fields in our dataset that have come on stream 
since the start of the current decade is 14.5%, compared with 11.6% for post-peak fields that 
started producing in the 1990s and only 5.9% for fields that started producing no later than 
1969 (Table 10.10). This pattern applies to both OPEC and non-OPEC fields (Figure 10.7). 
The very low average decline rate for the pre-1970s vintage of OPEC fields — less than 3% — 
is influenced strongly by the very low observed post-peak decline rate of the Ghawar field 
(0.3%). The fall in the decline rate for OPEC fields that came into production since 2000 is 
explained by the fact that most of them, while past their initial peak, are still at plateau.

As explained in the previous section, advances in production technology and changes in 
commercial practice mean that fields developed today tend to build up more quickly 
to a higher plateau, maintained over a shorter period of time, than fields developed 
before the 1990s. The growing importance since the 1970s of offshore fields (which 
normally reach a higher peak as a share of reserves than onshore fields) also explains 
this trend. It follows that the post-peak decline rate from such shorter and accelerated 
production profiles is higher.

Decline  rates  show  some  variation  according  to  the  decline  period  (Box  10.3 
for definitions), though the differences are less marked than for other factors including 
field size. For all post-peak fields still in decline phase 1 (i.e. whose production in 
the most recent year is still more than 85% of peak), the average decline rate is 1.4% 
(Table 10.11). The decline rate rises to 3.6% for those fields in decline phase 2 and to 
6.7% in decline phase 3. For all three decline periods, rates are always lowest for the 
super-giant fields, with those still in decline phase 1 registering an average decline rate 
of only 0.8%. Once again, the large weight of the Ghawar field in this group of fields helps 
to lower the overall decline rate. The rise in the observed decline rate as a field reaches 
the end of its life is probably explained by the increase in the rate of decline in pressure.

Trends in observed decline rates
For individual fields, observed decline rates would be expected to change over time, 
because of changes in well productivity, as pressure drops, and in production policy, 
and because of investment in field re-development. At any given moment, fields will 
be at different stages of their production life, so the rate of observed decline averaged 
over all fields in decline inevitably changes over time. We have calculated the year-
on-year change in production, averaged across all the post-peak fields in our dataset 
(all the decline rates shown up to this point correspond to the average over the life 
of each field). For each year, only those fields that were in decline were included in 
the calculation. The results show that the production-weighted average rate of fall in 
production has fluctuated significantly over time, but has been relatively more stable 
since the 1980s, at around 5% to 12% per year (Figure 10.8). 
Short-term fluctuations appear to reflect the impact of the production policies of OPEC 
countries and cyclical changes in investment in existing fields, resulting from policy, 
geopolitical factors and fluctuations in oil prices and fiscal terms. The very rapid fall in 
production in 1980 is explained primarily by the collapse in output at several fields in 
Iran following the Iranian revolution in late 1979, while the invasion of Kuwait, which

242 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
led to the loss of all of the country’s production for several months, caused the drop in 
output to accelerate in 1990 and 1991. The acceleration in the year-on-year rate of fall 
in production in the late 1990s was the result of a downturn in upstream investment, 
in response to a slump in prices, while the fall in the rate of decline since 2000 (with 
the exception of 2006, when production constraints in OPEC countries caused average 
rates of decline to accelerate) appears to have resulted from higher capital spending 
on re-developing existing fields.

Note: In contrast to the decline rates shown in the preceding tables and figures, which are based on the 
average decline rate of each field over a period of time determined by its peak or plateau, the rates of 
change shown here are calculated using simple year-on-year changes in each field’s production. For each 
year, the dataset is adjusted to include only those fields that were in the post-peak phase and that were 
in decline in that year. As a result, the sample size diminishes going backwards in time. For example, the 
number of fields that were post-peak in 1970 was 36 compared with 580 in 2007. The decline rates may 
therefore be considered less representative of all rates for all the world’s producing fields for the earliest 
years than for 2007.

Deriving an estimate of the average global observed decline rate
Our field-by-field analysis of decline rates allows us to obtain a reasonable estimate 
of the average decline rates for all the fields in the world, weighted by production. All 
the decline rates presented so far in this chapter are based on field-by-field production 
data  from  our  database,  covering  798  fields.  The  average  size  of  these  fields  — 
predominantly super-giants and giants — is significantly larger than the average size of 
all the fields in the world. The 580 fields included in our analysis of post-peak decline 
rates produced 40.5 mb/d of crude oil in 2007 — equal to 58% of world production. Yet 
these fields make up less than 1% of all the producing fields in the world. 
It is impossible to know precisely what the observed decline rates are for these other 
fields. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the decline rates are, on average, 
at least as high as these of the large fields in our database. In reality, they are likely

Chapter 10 - Field-by-field analysis of oil production 243
10
to be somewhat higher, given that we have detected a clear correlation between field 
size and the observed decline rate. In order to derive an indicative estimate of the 
overall decline rate for all the world’s oilfields, we have assumed that the average 
rate for the fields not included in our database is the same as that for the large fields 
(which averages 10.4% worldwide). This is a somewhat optimistic assumption, as the 
differences in decline rates between the three categories of fields we assess here 
suggest that smaller fields are likely to have higher decline rates than large fields. On 
this basis, we estimate that the average observed decline rate worldwide is 6.7%. Were 
that rate to be applied to 2007 crude oil production, the annual loss of output would 
be 4.7 mb/d. The adjusted decline rate is higher in all regions, markedly so in North 
America, because our sample for that region is dominated by super-giant and giant 
fields (Table 10.12).

Trends in natural decline rates
Estimating historical trends
Observed  decline  rates  are  an  important  indicator  of  the  performance  of  oilfields 
across regions and over time, but, by themselves, they do not reveal underlying trends 
in field production behaviour. This is because observed rates are heavily influenced by 
on-going and periodic investment in fields already in production, aimed at maintaining 
well  pressure  and  flow  rates,  and  improving  recovery  of  oil  reserves.  In  reality, 
few  oilfields  are  left  to  produce  without  further  field-development  work  involving 
significant amounts of capital expenditure once the initial set of wells has been drilled. 
This further investment can take the form of infill drilling (to target pockets of oil that 
prove to be inaccessible from existing wells), well work-overs (major maintenance 
or  remedial  treatments,  often  involving  the  removal  and  replacement  of  the  well 
casing), secondary recovery programmes such as water flooding (the injection of water 
to push the oil towards producing wells) and gas injection and enhanced oil recovery 
techniques, such as CO 2  injection. Such activities can arrest the natural decline in

pressure  and  production  from  a  field  and  may  even  boost  output  to  a  significant 
degree. It is necessary to estimate the underlying, or natural decline rate — the rate at 
which production at a field would decline in the absence of any investment — in order 
to ascertain how much capital needs to be deployed to sustain production or limit 
observed decline to a particular rate.    
To arrive at the natural decline rate, therefore, one needs to strip out the effect of 
new investment beyond the initial capital spending involved in bringing the field into 
production.  We  have  developed  a  top-down  methodology  for  estimating  historical 
natural decline rates, based on the estimated impact of the actual investment that 
has gone into existing fields over the past five years (summarised in Figure 10.9). This 
approach  required  detailed  estimates  of  the  amount  of  new  capacity  coming  into 
production each year over 2003-2007, the associated capital expenditure and the unit 
cost of incremental capacity at existing fields, based on generic (region-by-region) 
estimates of finding and development costs and reserve life estimates (drawing on the 
results of our analysis of investment in Chapter 13). The results were calibrated against 
our estimates of observed decline rates for all fields worldwide. Inevitably, a degree of 
judgment was involved, in consultation with industry, in estimating these parameters, 
given data deficiencies. The results must, therefore, be considered as indicative only.

The production-weighted average annual natural decline rate for the world as a whole is 
estimated at 9.0% — some 2.3 percentage points higher than the observed decline rate 
for post-peak fields. In other words, the decline in production from existing fields would 
have been around one-third faster had there been no capital spending on those fields

once they had passed their peak. Natural decline rates are highest for OECD Europe 
and Pacific (Australia), and Asia. The rate is lowest for the Middle East. The difference 
between observed and natural decline rates varies in both absolute and proportionate 
terms across regions (Figure 10.10). Nonetheless, the ratio of observed to natural decline 
rates, which averages about 1:1.3, is broadly similar across all regions, suggesting that 
these  estimates  are  reasonably  robust.  The  smallest  difference  between  observed 
and  natural  rates  is  for  Europe  (North  Sea).  This  appears  to  reflect  the  relatively 
limited  remaining  scope  for  infill  drilling  compared  with  other  parts  of  the  world.

Discerning a trend from the short time period we used to estimate natural decline 
rates is risky. Nonetheless, a clear rising trend does emerge from our analysis: the 
worldwide average natural decline rate (year-on-year) rose from 8.7% in 2003 to 9.7%
in 2007 (the average rate is 9% for the period 2003-2007 as a whole). This result is in 
line with expectations, as over that period, a growing share of crude oil production 
came from younger, smaller and offshore fields, which have inherently higher decline 
rates.  Smaller  and  offshore  fields  typically  exhibit  higher  observed  decline  rates, 
because of the more limited potential for infill drilling, as mentioned in the previous 
section. But natural decline rates would also be expected to be higher too, as these 
fields tend to be developed in such a way as to maximise and bring forward peak 
production in order to improve cash-flow and amortise the large up-front investment as 
quickly as possible. Development programmes for larger fields typically are less likely 
to be driven by purely financial considerations and are more likely to be effected by a 
policy of maximising ultimate recovery rates. 
Other recent studies support the finding that natural decline rates have been rising. 
For example, the natural decline rates of fields operated by 15 major oil companies 
rose on average from 10.6% to 13% between 2001 and 2006 (Goldman Sachs, 2007). The 
higher rate for these companies is to be expected, since a relatively large share of their 
production comes from OECD regions (notably North America) and West Africa, where 
decline rates are highest. The increase in the overall rate of natural decline, based on 
our analysis, is far from negligible: based on world crude oil production of 70.2 mb/d

246 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
in 2007, this increase represents an additional annual loss of capacity through natural 
decline of around 700 kb/d. The implication is that an additional 700 kb/d of gross 
capacity — the equivalent of almost one-and-a-half projects the size of Khursaniyah in 
Saudi Arabia — had to be brought on stream in 2007 simply to offset the higher rate of 
natural decline compared with five years before.
Case  studies  of  how  individual  fields  have  behaved  in  the  absence  of  any  major 
investment provide a way of verifying the extent to which natural decline rates deviate 
from observed rates. In reality, there are few cases where a field has been left to 
decline over a long period without any capital spending whatsoever. Some cases can, 
nonetheless, be identified. The collapse of the Soviet Union caused upstream investment 
virtually to dry up for several years in the first half of the 1990s and led to a precipitous 
drop  in  oil  production.  During  1990-1995,  the  production-weighted  average  annual 
decline rate for the 19 largest Russian fields (with reserves in excess of 1 billion barrels) 
that were in decline at that time was close to 14%, though decline rates were certainly 
exaggerated by a lack of spending on operation and maintenance, too. Among those 
fields, Samotlor — the world’s sixth-largest in terms of initial reserves — experienced a 
year-on-year production decline of more than 16% over the same period. 
Among all the North Sea fields in our dataset, we have identified only nine that were 
not subject to any major development programme over a period of at least three years 
(the majority of fields have been developed in a continuous fashion, with sustained 
capital spending over much of the life of the field). The (arithmetic) average decline 
rate is 13.7% for all the fields in this sample (Table 10.13), which is very close to the 
natural decline rate we estimate for all North Sea fields (which make up virtually all 
of Europe’s production) based on 2002-2007 data. Decline rates among the nine fields 
range from under 6% to over 20%.

The  apparent  inverse  relationship  between  field  size  and  the  natural  decline  rate 
mirrors that between the rate of depletion of recoverable reserves (measured by the 
ratio of remaining reserves to production, R/P) and the decline rate. The R/P ratio is 
inversely correlated with the natural decline rate at the regional level, even though we 
have only eight regional data points. The four regions with the lowest R/P ratio — OECD 
North America, Europe and the Pacific, together with Asia — have the highest natural 
decline rates, while the Middle East, with the highest R/P ratio, has the lowest decline 
rate (Figure 10.11). In short, the natural decline rate appears to rise over time as a 
producing region matures and the R/P ratio drops.

Long-term prospects for natural decline rates
The scale of upstream investment required to match oil production to demand in the 
medium to long term hinges critically on the evolution of natural decline rates. The 
rate and type of investment, both in existing oilfields and in new fields, that will come 
on stream over the projection period will determine the extent to which observed 
decline rates diverge from natural rates.
There is little reason to suppose that, for a given type and size of field in a specific 
location, the natural decline rate will change significantly in the future. However, 
a change in the mix of fields that will be developed in the future, including a shift 
towards smaller reservoirs and offshore deepwater fields, would be expected to drive 
up natural decline rates over time in all regions. On the other hand, a larger share of 
new field developments over the projection period is expected to come from onshore 
locations in the Middle East, where natural decline rates are the lowest (mainly because 
the average size of fields is high). This factor will offset, at least partially, the effect of 
declining field size on the weighted-average natural decline rate worldwide.

248 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
We have assessed, by region, how average natural decline rates weighted by production 
could change in the future, using our Reference Scenario projections of crude oil and 
NGLs  production,  and  additions  to  proven  and  probable  reserves  through  reserves 
growth and discoveries (described in detail in Chapter 11). The correlation between 
the R/P ratio and the natural decline rate is applied to the projected R/P ratio in each 
region to derive an estimate of how the natural rate in each case might evolve between 
2007 and 2030 (Figure 10.12). The results suggest that natural decline rates will tend 
to  rise  in  all  regions.  At  the  world  level,  the  increase  in  the  production-weighted 
average decline rate over the projection period is about 1.5 percentage points, taking 
the rate to around 10.5% per year in 2030. The increase is particularly pronounced 
in North America, where the natural decline rate increases from about 14% to 17%, 
while the R/P ratio falls to about 10 years (as remaining reserves fall even faster than 
production).

CHAPTER 11
PROSPECTS FOR OIL PRODUCTION
Running faster to stand still?
In the Reference Scenario, world oil production (not including processing gains)   z
rises by 26%, from 82.3 mb/d in 2007 to 103.8 mb/d in 2030. The share of OPEC 
countries in global output increases from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2030. Saudi Arabia 
remains the world’s largest producer throughout the projection period, its output 
climbing from 10.2 mb/d to 15.6 mb/d.
Worldwide, conventional crude oil production increases only modestly between   z
2007 and 2030 — by 5 mb/d — as almost all the additional capacity from new 
oilfields is offset by the decline in output at existing fields. Output from known 
oilfields that are already being developed or are awaiting development expands 
through to 2020, but then begins to drop, as few such fields are left to be brought 
into production and many of them enter their decline phase. Fields that are yet 
to be found account for about a quarter of total crude oil production by 2030. 
The bulk of the net increase in total oil production comes from natural gas liquids   z
(NGLs), driven by the relatively rapid expansion in gas supply, and from non-
conventional resources and technologies. Enhanced oil recovery, predominately 
from CO
2
 injection, makes a growing contribution.
The regional breakdown of world oil production does not change dramatically   z
over the projection period, but there are some important country-level changes. 
Saudi Arabia sees the largest incremental increase in oil production, followed by 
Canada. Brazil and Kazakhstan see large increases in output, while production in 
Russia falls. NGLs in Saudi Arabia and crude oil in Iraq dominate the increase in 
OPEC output.
Non-OPEC production of crude oil and NGLs declines from 44.8 mb/d in 2007 to   z
43.5 mb/d in 2015 and then falls further to 42.9 mb/d in 2030 in the Reference 
Scenario. Non-OPEC non-conventional oil production, in contrast, rises from 1.5 
mb/d in 2007 to 7.9 mb/d in 2030.
OPEC  crude  oil  and  NGL  production  increases  from  35.9  mb/d  in  2007  to   z
44.0 mb/d in 2015 and to 52.0 mb/d in 2030, on the assumption that there are 
no major disruptions in supply and that the requisite investment occurs. The 
increase in crude oil and NGL output comes mainly from onshore fields: offshore 
production  falls  after  2015,  despite  rising  output  in  Angola  and  Nigeria.  The 
average size of onshore fields in Middle East OPEC countries declines over the 
Outlook period, especially after 2015.

250 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
These projections call for huge investments to explore for and develop more   z
reserves, mainly to combat decline at existing fields. An additional 64 mb/d of 
gross capacity — the equivalent of six times that of Saudi Arabia today — needs 
to be brought on stream between 2007 and 2030. A faster rate of decline than 
projected  here  would  sharply  increase  upstream  investment  needs  and  oil 
prices. 
Global oil-production trends
Summary of projections in the Reference Scenario
In the Reference Scenario, world oil production rises (not including processing gains) by 
26%, from 82.3 mb/d in 2007 to 103.8 mb/d in 2030. Declines in crude oil production 
at existing fields (those already in production in 2007) are more than compensated for 
by output from fields under or awaiting development and, mainly in the last decade 
of  the  Outlook  period,  fields  that  are  yet  to  be  found  (Figure  11.1).  Worldwide, 
production of conventional crude oil alone increases only modestly, from 70.2 mb/d 
to 75.2 mb/d over the period. The share of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and enhanced 
oil  recovery  (EOR),  predominately  from  CO
2
  injection,  in  total  oil  production  rises 
considerably, from 13% in 2007 to 25% in 2030. The contribution of non-conventional 
oil also rises substantially, from 2% in 2007 to 8.5% in 2030, with a marked spurt in the 
decade commencing now. Cumulative conventional oil production (crude and NGLs), 
which stood at 1.1 trillion barrels in 2007, is projected to rise to over 1.8 trillion barrels 
by  2030.  Its  share  of  currently  estimated  ultimately  recoverable  resources  would, 
therefore, rise from slightly less than a third today to around one-half by 2030, though 
any  increase  in  resources,  for  example,  brought  about  by  advances  in  technology, 
would result in a smaller increase in that share.

The  projections  take  account  of  build-up  and  decline  rates  at  existing  fields  and 
those  that  will  come  on  stream  over  the  projection  period,  new  capacities  from 
current, sanctioned and planned upstream projects, and potential discoveries over 
the  projection  period  based  on  our  country-by-country  assessment  of  ultimately 
recoverable reserves (Box 11.1). Assumptions about decline rates are based on the 
analysis of Chapter 10.
The  share  of  world  oil  production  from  member  countries  of  the  Organization  of 
the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC),  particularly  in  the  Middle  East,  grows 
significantly, from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2030. Their collective output of crude oil 
and NGLs grows from 35.9 mb/d in 2007 to 44.0 mb/d in 2015 and 52.0 mb/d in 2030 
(Table 11.1). The contribution of NGLs to total conventional output in OPEC countries 
(and to a lesser extent elsewhere), rises quickly over the projection period, reaching 
25% of OPEC output in 2030, compared with 13% in 2007. Saudi Arabia remains the 
world’s largest oil producer throughout the projection period, its production climbing 
from 10.2 mb/d in 2007 to 15.6 mb/d in 2030.

Non-OPEC production increases much more slowly, from its current level of 46.3 mb/d 
to 47.6 mb/d in 2015 and 50.9 mb/d in 2030. Crude oil production alone is projected 
to decline slowly, from 39.1 mb/d in 2007 to 36.3 mb/d in 2030, as output from

offshore fields is unable to fully compensate for a steady drop in onshore production. 
The share of non-OPEC countries in world oil production declines by 7 percentage 
points, from 56% now to 49% in 2030. The reduction in non-OPEC production would be 
even more pronounced were it not for the growing contribution of oil from enhanced 
oil recovery (EOR) projects, which rises from 0.4 mb/d in 2007 to 3.6 mb/d in 2030.
Box 11.1  z   Modelling oil production in 
WEO-2008
  
For WEO-2008, trends in oil production to 2030 are modelled using a bottom-up 
methodology, making extensive use of the IHS database of worldwide proven 
and probable reserves and discovered fields, and country-by-country estimates 
of  ultimately  recoverable  resources  from  the  US  Geological  Survey  (USGS). 
The  methodology  aims  to  replicate  investment  decisions  in  the  oil  industry
by  analysing  the  profitability  of  developing  reserves  at  the  project  level
(Figure 11.2). 
In the model, production in countries that are assumed to be open to private 
companies  is  separately  derived,  according  to  the  type  of  asset  in  which 
investments are made: existing fields, new fields, non-conventional projects and 
exploration. Standard production profiles are applied to derive the production 
trend for existing fields and for those new fields (by country and type of field) 
which are brought into production over the projection period (see Chapter 10). 
Cash available for investments is a function of past production, the international 
oil  price  (taking  account  of  the  government  take  in  oil  revenues)  and  the 
investment  policies  of  oil  companies.  Investment  is  made  only  in  profitable 
projects. New projects generate cash, which is then spent on future profitable 
projects.
The profitability of each type of project is based on assumptions about the capital 
and operating costs of different types of projects, the hurdle price (expressed 
as a proportion of the actual oil price assumed in the Reference Scenario) and 
the discount rate, representing the cost of capital. The net present value of the 
cash-flows of each type of project is derived from a standard production profile, 
which is determined by the size of the field and its location onshore or offshore. 
Projects are prioritised by their net present value and available cash is spent on 
the most potentially profitable projects, with total capital spending constrained 
by the total available cash-flow of the industry.
Investment in exploration, which is assumed to absorb a fixed share of total cash-
flow, determines the number of exploration wells drilled (based on assumptions 
about  the  cost  of  drilling).  For  each  country,  the  amount  of  oil  discovered 
(onshore and offshore) each year is based on an historical analysis which allows 
us to determine the relationship between the cumulative number of exploration 
wells  and  the  total  amount  of  oil  found  (known  as  a  “creaming  curve”). 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Chapter 11 - Prospects for oil production 253
11
It was further assumed that total discoveries equal the ultimately recoverable 
resources, as estimated by the USGS. 
The  main  assumptions  used  in  the  model  are  the  international  oil  price, 
exploration and development costs, the marginal tax take of the host country, 
and the rate of re-investment of cash-flows by oil companies. The price used to 
evaluate the profitability of projects is assumed to be a function of the assumed 
international  market  price.  We  assumed  the  current  fiscal  regimes  and  the 
average rates of re-investment observed by the oil industry in 2007 to remain 
constant over the projection period. We also assume in the Reference Scenario 
that upstream costs level off in 2009 and remain flat thereafter in real terms. 
The oil-supply projections for countries which are considered to be closed to 
international investments are based on exogenous assumptions about investment, 
on a country-by country basis, derived from announced plans and policies, as 
well as our judgment of the feasibility of the investment being made. Here, too, 
we apply standard production profiles to the fields which are assumed to be 
developed. The countries in question include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, 
Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Mexico and Venezuela — all of which, bar Mexico, 
are members of OPEC.
The projected growth in global oil production is significantly lower than in last year’s 
Outlook (but so, too, is demand). Total oil production in 2030, including non-conventional 
supplies (but not biofuels) is almost 10 mb/d lower than in WEO-2007. This reflects the 
slower economic growth assumption and the impact on demand of the large upward 
adjustment in our oil-price assumption. This oil price is, in turn, based on a re-assessment 
of the prospects for upstream investment in the main resource-rich countries, in light of 
the large escalation of project costs (see Chapter 13). It now looks much less likely that 
the key producing countries, in particular, will be willing and able to expand capacity 
as much and as quickly as previously assumed. Thus, this year’s Reference Scenario 
resembles  closely  the  Deferred  Investment  Scenario  of  WEO-2005  (IEA,  2005).  As  a 
result, a bigger share of production will need to come from non-OPEC countries, where 
decline rates and development costs are generally much higher (see Chapters 10 and 13). 
Combined with sharp increases in upstream capital and operating costs, higher prices 
will be needed to bring forth the investment needed to expand capacity and to balance 
supply with demand. As always, future investment and decline rates are uncertain. The 
results of an analysis of the sensitivity of global oil markets to changes in these factors 
are presented in the last section of this chapter.

Crude oil output at existing fields 
Our oil-production projections are based on a rigorous analysis of trends in output at 
existing fields (defined as those that were producing in 2007), which is also applied 
to  known  fields  yet  to  be  developed  and  fields  yet  to  be  found.  Among  existing 
fields, some are still building up, some are at plateau and the rest are in decline 
(see Chapter 10). Thus, the average year-on-year fall in the aggregate production of 
these fields will tend to accelerate over time, as more and more of them enter their 
decline phase. In the Reference Scenario, we assume that the decline rate (year-on-
year) for all oilfields, once they have passed their peak, is constant for given types 
and sizes of fields in each region. However, the expected shift in the sources of crude 
oil, in terms of region, location and field size, means that the average production-
weighted observed post-peak decline rate tends to rise, from 6.7% at the start of the 
projection period to 8.6% by the end. 1
In total, output of crude oil from existing oilfields (not including non-conventional 
projects) drops from 70 mb/d in 2007 to 51 mb/d by 2015 and 27 mb/d by 2030 —
a fall of 43 mb/d (excluding projected production using EOR). As a result, 64 mb/d of 
new capacity, in gross terms, needs to be brought on stream between 2007 and 2030 in 
order to maintain capacity at the 2007 level and meet the projected 21 mb/d increase 
in demand. The gross new capacity required by 2015 is about 30 mb/d. Oil production 
from existing oil sands and extra-heavy oil projects typically declines much less rapidly, 
as output is largely determined by the accessibility of the deposits and the intensity of 
mining or steam injection (see Chapter 9).
Production from existing offshore fields declines much more rapidly than that from 
onshore fields, for the reasons outlined in Chapter 10. On average, output from existing 
onshore fields falls at a year-on-year rate of 3.2%, from 46 mb/d in 2007 to 22 mb/d 
in 2030. Output drops much more quickly at existing offshore fields, by an average 
of 6.3% per year, from 24 mb/d to 5 mb/d. The overall average annual fall in output 
at existing fields is proportionately much smaller in OPEC countries, at 3.3%, than 
in non-OPEC countries, where it is 4.7%, reflecting the fact that most OPEC fields 
are onshore. Production at existing fields falls by 17 mb/d in OPEC countries over 
2007-2030, compared with 26 mb/d in non-OPEC countries (Figure 11.3).
The biggest fall in crude oil output from existing fields, in absolute terms, occurs 
in the Middle East, where some 11 mb/d of capacity needs to be replaced (Figure 
11.4). This simply reflects the fact that this region is, by far, the biggest single 
producing region: the rate of the overall fall in production — an average of around 
3% per year — is actually lower than that in any other region. In OECD Europe and 
OECD Pacific, offshore fields account for most of the loss of oil output; in Asia and 
Africa, the losses are evenly spread between offshore and onshore fields. Russian 
and  other  eastern  European/Eurasian  countries  account  for  17%  of  the  overall
43 mb/d fall in output.

Contribution of new fields to crude oil production
Despite continuing investment in the world’s existing fields, their aggregate output 
begins to decline already in 2008, as declines at mature fields outweigh increases 
at fields recently brought on stream. Output from new conventional oilfields, not 
yet in production, makes the biggest contribution to compensating for this loss of 
capacity  and  meeting  rising  global  oil  demand,  with  the  remainder  coming  from 
non-conventional sources and from enhanced oil recovery (at both existing fields and 
those that will be developed during the projection period). 
New conventional oil production will come both from known fields (included in proven 
and probable reserves) that are awaiting development and from fields that have yet to 
be found (as a result of exploration) but that are expected to be developed before 2030. 
The contribution of production from fields now awaiting development is projected to be

11
the larger of the two, even in 2030, but their share of gross capacity additions falls quickly 
towards the end of the projection period. Overall output from those fields peaks soon after 
2020 as more and more of them are brought on stream, mature and enter their decline 
phase. By contrast, the contribution from fields yet to be found grows quickly after 2015, 
as more of them are found and are selected for development, in some cases ahead of yet-
to-be-developed known fields (Figure 11.5). By 2030, output from yet-to-be-found fields 
(19 mb/d) approaches that from known but yet-to-be-developed fields (23 mb/d).

Known but yet-to-be-developed fields
At  the  end  of  2007,  world  conventional  oil  reserves  in  fields  that  have  been 
discovered but not yet developed amounted to an estimated 257 billion barrels. 2    
OPEC  countries  held  133  billion  barrels,  or  just  over  half.  About  65%  of  OPEC’s 
undeveloped  conventional  reserves  are  located  onshore.  In  non-OPEC  countries, 
onshore reservoirs account for only 38% of total reserves.  Over half of the world’s 
undeveloped reserves are in the Middle East and Russia. The Middle East alone holds 
99 billion barrels, nearly 40% of the world total.
Production  from  these  yet-to-be-developed  fields  is  projected  to  rise  steadily  to
a  peak  of  29  mb/d  just  after  2020  and  then  fall  back  to  around  23  mb/d  in  2030
(Figure 11.6). This means that 220 billion barrels out of the 257 currently identified, or 
86%, are produced over the projection period. By 2030, the contribution from onshore 
fields  is  twice  as  large  as  that  from  offshore  fields,  although  offshore  production 
dominates until about 2020. In non-OPEC countries, known yet-to-be developed fields 
contribute 11 mb/d in 2030, after peaking at 16 mb/d. Offshore production represents 
over two-thirds of total output from these fields until about 2020. In OPEC countries, 
yet-to-be-developed  fields  produce  11  mb/d  in  2030,  slightly  down  on  the  peak  of
14 mb/d.

Onshore yet-to-be-developed reserves are concentrated in the Middle East and Russia. 
Together, they account for three-quarters of all onshore fields awaiting development. 
Offshore reserves are more equally distributed worldwide (Figure 11.7). The majority

and nearly all of them in Latin America and OECD Europe and Pacific are offshore.

Yet-to-be-found fields
Conventional oil production from yet-to-be-found fields is projected to reach 19 mb/d 
in 2030, based on the projected discovery of 114 billion barrels of reserves worldwide 
over the projection period. Almost 11 mb/d comes from offshore fields (Figure 11.9). 
Onshore production comes mostly from OPEC countries — 8 mb/d out of a total of

260 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
8.7 mb/d in 2030 — as most undiscovered resources in the Middle East are onshore 
(USGS, 2000). By contrast, the bulk of production from yet-to-be-found offshore fields 
comes from non-OPEC countries: they produce 7.9 mb/d out of a total of 10.7 mb/d 
in 2030. Non-OPEC offshore yet-to-be-found fields are about equally divided between 
Russia and other Eurasian countries, Africa and OECD North America.
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
Production  using  EOR  technology  is  projected  to  contribute  an  additional
6.4 mb/d  3  to world oil supply in 2030, with most of the increase occurring after 2015
(Figure 11.10). Three-quarters of this increase comes from just four countries: the 
United States, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China (in ranked order). Cumulative production 
in 2007-2030 amounts to 24 billion barrels, out of an estimated potential of about
300 billion barrels — of which one-third is in Saudi Arabia (see Chapter 9). 
Most  of  the  new  EOR  projects  that  are  expected  to  be  implemented  during  the 
projection  period  involve  CO
2
  injection.  In  total,  about  9.8  gigatonnes  of  CO
2
  is 
captured and stored in CO
2
-EOR oil projects over the projection period. 4  These projects 
are exclusively onshore, as the technology for offshore CO
2
-EOR is not expected to be 
sufficiently advanced for it to be deployed before the end of the projection period. 
Current EOR technology typically recovers about an additional 10% of oil in place. A 
bigger and more widely applied carbon penalty than assumed in the Reference Scenario 
(see Chapter 1) would significantly increase the potential for EOR.

Natural gas liquids (NGLs)
Output  of  natural  gas  liquids  —  light  hydrocarbons  that  exist  in  liquid  form 
underground  and  that  are  produced  together  with  natural  gas  and  recovered 
in  separation  facilities  or  processing  plants  —  is  expected  to  grow  rapidly  over 
the  Outlook  period.  Global  NGL  production  is  projected  to  almost  double,  from
10.5 mb/d in 2007 to just under 20 mb/d in 2030. This increase is driven by the steady 
rise in natural gas output (see Chapter 12). The bulk of the increase comes from OPEC 
countries, where gas production (to supply local markets and new LNG projects) is 
projected to expand quickest. OPEC NGL production almost triples, from 4.7 mb/d 
in  2007  to  over  13  mb/d  in  2030.  The  Middle  East  accounts  for  four-fifths  of  this 
increase. Non-OPEC NGL production increases by about 1 mb/d, to close to 7 mb/d in 
2030 (Figure 11.11). These projections assume that the average NGL content of gas 
production is constant over the projection period.

Non-conventional oil
Non-conventional  oil  —  extra-heavy  oil  (excluding  Venezuela),  oil  sands,  chemical 
additives, gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids — is expected to play an important role in 
offsetting the decline in production from existing fields and supplementing supplies 
from new conventional oilfields and NGLs. The global supply of non-conventional oil 
is projected to increase from 1.7 mb/d in 2007 to 8.8 mb/d in 2030 (Figure 11.12). 
Canadian  oil-sands  projects  make,  by  far,  the  largest  contribution,  increasing  by 
4.7 mb/d, followed by coal-to-liquids (CTL) projects in the United States and China, 
which together increase by 1 mb/d. Output from gas-to-liquids (GTL) projects expands 
from about 50 kb/d in 2007 to 650 kb/d in 2030. These projections need particular 
qualification,  especially  those  for  gas-  and  coal-to-liquids,  given  the  uncertainties 
about future choices of technology and the resulting mix of fuels, the evolution of 
the technologies, how production costs will develop relative to alternative ways of 
exploiting the resources and future environmental constraints.

Oil sands and extra-heavy oil
Production of oil from Canadian oil sands is projected to increase from 1.2 mb/d in 
2007 to 5.9 mb/d in 2030. Total proven recoverable oil-sands reserves are estimated 
at 175 billion barrels, of which 35 billion barrels can be mined and 140 billion barrels 
can be produced in situ (see Chapter 9). All the mineable reserves are projected to be 
developed over the projection period, with production from mining projects reaching 
about  1.4  mb/d  in  2030.  Current  mining  techniques  are  not  economic  if  the  depth 
of the oil sands exceeds about 75 metres; since most oil-sands reserves lie at depths 
which require the use of in situ steam-assisted production techniques, almost all of the 
projected increase in oil-sands production comes from in situ projects. Of the more 
than 50 billion barrels that are projected to be developed to 2030, only about 30 billion 
barrels derive from projects that are already sanctioned, planned or at the feasibility 
study stage. Our projections of oil-sands production are inevitably uncertain in view of 
the environmental challenges, notably water needs and CO 2  emissions (see Chapter 9).

Extra-heavy oil production projects are expected to be concentrated in Venezuela (such 
as the Carabobo project), as this country holds the major part of the relevant world 
resources. However, due to the IEA practice of classifying extra-heavy oil in Venezuela 
as  conventional  oil,  Venezuelan  extra-heavy  oil  production  is  not  included  here. 
Production of extra-heavy oil outside Venezuela is projected to occur mainly in Kuwait 
and in a few isolated projects in Brazil, Vietnam and Italy, and may reach more than
0.7 mb/d in the last decade of the projection period.
Gas-to-liquids (GTL)
GTL  technology  involves  converting  natural  gas  into  liquid  fuels  with  longer-chain 
hydrocarbons,  such  as  diesel  fuels  that  can  be  directly  used  to  fuel  diesel-engine 
vehicles, naphtha and chemical feedstock. GTL technology generally uses the principles 
of the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process, in which methane-rich natural gas is transformed, 
via  steam-reforming  or  partial  oxidation,  into  a  mixture  of  carbon  monoxide  and 
hydrogen, called “syngas”. Catalytic conversion converts the syngas into diesel fuels. 
While the F-T process was developed in the 1920s, significant progress has been made 
on the design of catalysts. The trend is to move from iron to cobalt and other metals. 
Three plants — Sasol’s Mossel plant in South Africa, Shell’s Bintulu plant in Malaysia and 
the Oryx plant in Qatar (a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Sasol) — account 
for the bulk of the 50 kb/d of GTL capacity currently in operation worldwide. Two plants 
are under construction: Shell’s 140-kb/d Pearl project in Qatar, the first train of which is 
due on stream by the end of the current decade and the second by 2012, and Chevron/
Nigerian  National  Petroleum  Corporation’s  34-kb/d  Escravos  project  in  Nigeria, 
expected on stream by the beginning of the next decade. They will bring total world 
capacity to above 200 kb/d by around 2012. All these plants will produce primarily 
diesel, together with smaller volumes of naphtha. 
The long-term prospects for GTL hinge critically on costs. Costs have dropped sharply 
in the past, from $120 000 per barrel per day of capacity in the mid-1950s to less than 
$40 000 in 2000 — partly due to economies of scale. But costs have rebounded in recent 
years, with the surge in capital and operating costs that has afflicted all sectors of the 
oil and gas industry and the higher cost of the gas feedstock. At present, each barrel 
of diesel produced requires 8 000 to 10 000 cubic feet of gas. Current GTL production 
costs per barrel are now in the range of $40 to $90, depending on the price of the 
feedstock gas. GTL plants generate between 0.2 and 0.25 tonnes of CO 2  per barrel 
produced. If a CO 2  penalty of $50 per tonne were introduced, production costs would 
rise  by  $10.00  to  $12.50  per  barrel  of  synfuel.  How  the  industry  might  develop  in 
the longer term is uncertain. Recent sharp increases in construction costs, technical 
difficulties in commissioning the Oryx plant and a tightening of LNG supply in the near 
to medium term may lead to a shift in strategy towards LNG in many gas-producing 
countries. GTL is a highly capital-intensive chemical process, involving more complex 
engineering and operation, compared with LNG.
In the Reference Scenario, fewer GTL projects are brought on stream than in last year’s 
Outlook. Planned plants in Egypt and Australia are assumed to proceed, but others, 
including that proposed in Qatar but delayed because of a moratorium on new gas 
projects, do not proceed. World GTL production reaches 650 kb/d in 2030.

264 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Coal-to-liquids (CTL)
CTL — a well-established technology that transforms coal into oil products — is expected to 
play a small but growing role in meeting the world’s fuel needs. The CTL process requires 
access to coal of stable quality, but has been given a new lease of life by technical 
improvements and by higher oil and gas prices. Global production of CTL is projected to 
grow from a mere 0.13 mb/d today to 1.1 mb/d in 2030. In addition to one plant that 
has been operating in South Africa for many years, a number of projects are assumed 
to be developed in China and the United States, because of their abundance of low-cost 
resources. India is not assumed to begin production of CTL before 2030, though plans to do 
so have been discussed for several years. The uncertainties surrounding CTL prospects are 
very large, because of technical, economic and environmental considerations. 
There are two main types of CTL technology in use or under development (IEA, 2006):
The  two-stage  liquefaction  process,  which  uses  gasification  of  coal  to  produce   
syngas and then a F-T process to generate the fuel. It has been commercially used in 
South Africa since 1955. The Secunda plants there currently produce the equivalent 
of 130 kb/d of fuels and chemicals, using three different types of catalyst (low-
temperature iron, high-temperature iron and low-temperature cobalt). The plants 
generally produce 20% to 30% of naphtha, along with 70% to 80% of diesel, kerosene 
and fuel oil. The process uses 0.35 to 0.45 tonnes of coal per barrel of oil produced. 
New plants have an overall energy efficiency of around 40%.
The more energy-efficient direct liquefaction process involves the dissolution at   
high temperature and pressure of a high percentage of coal in a solvent, followed 
by catalysed hydrocracking. The chemistry of this process is more complex. Output 
includes 20% to 30% of naphtha and 70% to 80% of diesel and liquefied petroleum gas. 
The first commercial project using the technology is the 20-kb/d Shenhua project 
located in Inner Mongolia (China), now nearing completion, with a planned capacity 
expansion to 100 kb/d. The process uses 0.3 to 0.4 tonnes of coal per barrel of oil 
produced. 
Average CTL capital costs for a 50-kb/d unit are estimated at around $85 000 per barrel 
per day of installed capacity (Rahim, 2008), with the gasification unit representing the 
largest cost component (30% of the total cost). Scale matters as both unit operating 
and capital costs fall by more than 30% with an increase in capacity from 10 to 80 kb/d. 
Cost factors vary regionally: costs in China are about 30% lower than the United States. 
Current costs for a plant in China with 1 million tonnes (Mt) per annum production 
capacity are $40 to $60 per barrel of oil produced.
A big drawback with CTL processes is their very high CO
2
 emissions: each barrel of oil 
produced gives rise to 0.5 to 0.7 tonnes of CO
2
. A 50-kb/d plant, accordingly, generates 
an average 11 Mt of CO
2
 per year. On this basis, a penalty of $50 per tonne of CO
2
 would 
add $20 to $30 per barrel to production costs. Large CTL projects will need access not 
only to large coal reserves (typically at least 2 billion tonnes), but also to CO
2
 storage 
sites if CCS is deployed. 
Plans to produce up to 30 Mt per year (around 600 kb/d) of fuels from CTL in China 
by 2020 have been announced. But environmental concerns, including emissions and

11
access  to  water,  along  with  spiralling  costs  and  coal  prices,  have  led  the  Chinese 
government to impose stricter rules for plant construction and operation. In the United 
States, several CTL projects have been announced, totalling more than 300 kb/d, but 
more are still at the feasibility study stage. 
Crude oil quality 
There has been a small shift in the average quality of crude oil produced over the past 
decade towards slightly heavier and higher-sulphur grades (Eni, 2006). The shift towards 
heavier crudes is expected to continue in the longer term, but not as fast as projected 
in previous WEOs. Indeed, average API gravity 5  is expected to rise through to 2011, 
mainly due to increased supplies of condensate and a preponderance of lighter (and 
sweeter) crudes coming from Saudi Arabia’s capacity-expansion programme (IEA, 2008). 
The fall in the average API gravity of world crude oil production resumes in 2012 and 
accelerates after 2015. The share of light and ultra-light grades (with an API gravity of 
at least 35°) in total crude oil production is projected to fall from 26.1% in 2005 to 24.4% 
in 2015 and 22.7% in 2030. The share of medium grades (with an API gravity of between 
26° and 35°) increases by one percentage point from 53.7% in 2005 to 54.6% in 2030. 
Heavy grades (with an API gravity of 10° to 26°) account for 16.1% of world production 
in 2030, up from 12.8% in 2005. The average sulphur content of crude oil worldwide 
is expected to rise appreciably in the longer term, from the current levels of close 
to 1.14%.

The near doubling of production of NGLs over the projection period helps to offset, 
in part, the projected modest fall in the average gravity of crude oil. NGLs include a 
mixture of propane, butane, pentane, ethane and other light hydrocarbons in widely 
varying proportions. The average API degree of these liquids is typically at least 60°.

liquids compared with water, expressed in degrees. The higher the degree, the lighter the oil.

Outlook by country and region 
There is no dramatic shift in the regional breakdown of world oil production over the 
projection period in the Reference Scenario, but there are some important changes at 
the country level (Figure 11.14). Saudi Arabia sees the largest incremental increase 
in oil production, followed by Canada. Eurasian countries, notably Kazakhstan, see a 
large increase in crude oil output, while production in Russia declines. Saudi Arabia 
and Iraq dominate the increase in OPEC (and Middle East) production, with most of the 
additional capacity coming from NGLs in Saudi Arabia and from crude oil in Iraq. In the 
United States, an increase in the production of non-conventional oil largely offsets a 
decline in conventional crude oil production.

Non-OPEC production
Non-OPEC production of crude oil and NGLs in the Reference Scenario declines from 
44.8 mb/d in 2007 to 43.5 mb/d in 2015 and then falls further to 42.9 mb/d in 2030 
(Table 11.3). Non-conventional oil production, in contrast, rises from 1.5 mb/d in 2007 
to 7.9 mb/d in 2030. Most of the decline in conventional production is a result of falling 
output levels in OECD countries, but that same group accounts for three-quarters of the 
increase in non-conventional oil output.
Investment  in  exploration  will  be  crucial  to  increasing  production  in  non-OPEC 
countries. The majority of the existing offshore fields in non-OPEC countries will be 
in the final decline phase of their production profile by 2030, resulting in a 12-mb/d 
drop in output compared with today. In the medium term, the shortfall is met from 
known but yet-to-be-developed fields, but output even from those fields is expected

11
to start to decline in aggregate by around 2020, from a peak of about 16 mb/d to about
11 mb/d in 2030. Output from offshore fields that are yet to be found starts to fill the 
gap from 2015 and reaches 8 mb/d in 2030.

Offshore fields account for most of the gross additions to conventional oil capacity 
in non-OPEC countries over the Outlook period. About 180 sanctioned, planned and 
proposed projects, to develop an estimated 65 billion barrels of proven and probable 
reserves, are projected to yield new production capacity over the next five to six 
years. Most of the offshore projects are small: only 44 of them concern fields holding 
more than 300 million barrels. The bulk of non-OPEC offshore production in this period, 
including both shallow offshore and deep water, comes from a few major projects, 
including Tupi in Brazil, the fifth phase of Sakhalin in Russia, Kashagan in Kazakhstan, 
Jidong Nanpu in China and ACG in Azerbaijan. Brazil and the United States (Gulf of 
Mexico) are the only non-OPEC countries with more than two major projects in the 
pipeline. Other smaller-scale offshore developments include Ku Maloob Zaap in Mexico, 
Kikeh and Gumusut-Kakap in Malaysia and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo. The 
overall paucity of projects in the near term is mostly due to the current high costs of 
developing offshore fields, low levels of investment in exploration over the past decade 
and unfavourable regulatory and fiscal frameworks.
In the longer term, most of the additional offshore production will come from about 
150  known  fields,  each  holding  between  50  and  600  million  barrels  of  proven  and 
probable reserves. In total, they hold about 20 billion barrels, in both shallow offshore 
and deep water. Again, Brazil has the largest offshore potential, with more than 50 
fields containing a total of some 8 billion barrels — equal to 40% of total non-OPEC known 
offshore undeveloped reserves. Continuing active exploration, notably in the pre-salt 
layer of the Santos Basin, is likely to boost Brazil’s proven reserves substantially in the 
coming years. The United States has about 15 undeveloped fields, holding a total of
1.5 billion barrels. Kazakhstan holds about 1 billion barrels in 5 fields, each of more 
than 50 million barrels. Mexico, Malaysia, Norway and the United Kingdom together 
hold  similar  potential  of  about  1  billion  barrels  in  about  5  to  7  fields.  They  also 
possess about 30 other discovered fields with reserves of less than 50 million barrels. 
The potential for offshore oil production in Russia is limited both by the number of

11
known fields (less than 10) and by volume (less than 1 billion barrels in total). Several 
discoveries have been made in Australia, Canada, Republic of Congo, Gabon, India, 
Thailand and Vietnam; but the average size of the fields is well below 100 million 
barrels, so their potential contribution to non-OPEC offshore production is limited at 
the prices assumed in the Reference Scenario and at current costs. Developing groups 
of small fields simultaneously could lower costs and make more of them economically 
viable. 
In contrast to the relative abundance of viable offshore projects, prospects for onshore 
projects in non-OPEC countries, outside of Russia, are very poor. Beyond 2015, the 
majority of known but yet-to-be-developed onshore fields with reserves of more than 
100 million barrels are located in Russia, where the physiographic location of the fields 
complicates their exploitation considerably. Mexico and China hold most of the rest 
of the onshore potential in non-OPEC countries in fields holding more than 100 million 
barrels. As for smaller fields holding between 50 and 100 million barrels, fewer than 
100 await development. Exploration will undoubtedly yield many new discoveries, but 
the maturity of the resource base in most non-OPEC regions suggests that the potential 
for finding fields that are large enough to be exploited profitably is fairly limited. In the 
Reference Scenario, yet-to-be-found onshore fields in non-OPEC countries contribute 
less than 1 mb/d in 2030, compared with 8 mb/d from offshore fields.
Oil production in the United States is expected to pick up slightly in the next few 
years, mainly thanks to a surge in output in the Gulf of Mexico. About 5 billion barrels 
of proven and probable reserves in the Gulf are expected to be developed before 2015. 
A major project, Thunder Horse, came on stream in the third quarter of 2008 — about 
three years later than originally planned. It is projected to produce over 200 kb/d 
at peak by the beginning of the next decade. Other fields, such as Atlantis, Kaskida, 
Tahiti, Shenzi, Great White, Puma and Cascade, add another 400 kb/d by 2015. The 
average size of these fields is about 200 million barrels — about 50% of the average 
field size in Brazil. They are located in deep water and, therefore, are likely to have 
high  post-peak  decline  rates  (see  Chapter  10).  Onshore,  the  Nikaitchuq  field  with 
about 200 million barrels of reserves, is also expected to be developed. The additions 
to US output from these projects compensate only temporarily for declines at existing 
fields in Alaska and in the lower 48 states. Production in the longer term is expected 
to resume its long-term downward trend, reaching 6.5 mb/d in 2030. The lifting of the 
moratorium on offshore drilling proposed by the current administration — not assumed 
in the Reference Scenario because Congress had not yet approved it at the time of 
writing — would temper the decline, but only marginally.
Canadian  production  will  become  increasingly  dominated  by  oil  sands  in  Alberta. 
Conventional crude oil production is projected to continue to decline, but this is largely 
offset by increased output of NGLs; the combined output edges down from 2.1 mb/d 
in 2007 to 1.9 mb/d in 2030. Oil-sands output, in contrast, jumps from 1.2 mb/d to 
5.9 mb/d.
Mexico’s  proven  oil  reserves  have  fallen  continuously  over  the  past  two  decades, 
mainly because of under-investment in exploration. In 2007, Mexico produced around 
3.5 mb/d of oil. Production at Cantarell, Mexico’s largest field and the third-largest 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
270 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
offshore field in the world by initial reserves, is falling sharply. Year-on-year declines 
averaged only 5% per year between the field’s peak in 2003 and 2007, but output has 
reportedly dropped precipitously since 2007: at end-2007, it was 16% down on the 
beginning of the year. According to Pemex, the national company and sole operator 
of all Mexican fields, output at Cantarell is set to fall by a further 16% by end-2008. 
Total Mexican crude oil production is projected to bottom out at around 2.4 mb/d by 
2015, as the Ku Maloob Zap and Chicontepec fields build up and reach their plateau. 
It then recovers gradually to more than 3 mb/d in the last decade of the projection 
period. Mexico holds 3 billion barrels of reserves in onshore fields which are yet to be 
developed and the above figures are boosted by output from new offshore discoveries 
— on the assumption that exploration is stepped up. 
In OECD Europe, production from mature North Sea basins will continue its long-term 
decline. Output is projected to drop to 3.3 mb/d by 2015 and 2.1 mb/d in 2030. Despite 
higher  oil  prices,  European  exploration  and  development  have  declined  sharply  in 
the last few years, as the prospects for discovering significant new reservoirs have 
deteriorated. Of more than 28 projects planned in the North Sea, only a handful hold 
more than 100 million barrels. The larger ones include the Lochnagar and Callanish/
Brodgar fields in the United Kingdom, which are projected to produce a bit less than 
100 kb/d until 2015, and the Goliat, Tyrihans, Alvheim and Skarv/Idun fields in Norway, 
with aggregate production of slightly less than 200 kb/d. Most of the other fields being 
developed are extensions to earlier developments.
Prospects for finding more oil in Australia are good. Projected output growth there is 
supported in the short term by production from the Angel and Pyrenees fields, and in 
the medium term by the Vincent and Enfield fields. Total production levels off at about 
0.5 mb/d in 2015, but grows to 0.6 mb/d in the second half of the projection period 
with new discoveries, although on average they are modest in size.
In Russia, production is expected to level off in the near term. The most significant 
onshore  projects  are  Vankorskoye  (with  3  billion  barrels  of  proven  and  probable 
reserves),  Priobskoye  (1.6  billion  barrels),  Verkhne-Chonskoye  (1.2  billion  barrels) 
and Talakanskoye (900 million barrels). All of these fields are due to start producing
oil before 2013, adding a total of 1.1 mb/d from around 2015. They start to decline
by around 2020. Other important fields holding significant reserves in the region of 
500 to 600 million barrels are also expected to be developed, including Tagulskoye and 
Suzunskoye (660 million barrels), Vladimir Filanovski (600 million barrels), Yurubcheno-
Tokhomskoye (560 million barrels), Salym (500 million barrels) and Khylchuyuskoye 
Yuzhnoye  (480  million  barrels).  The  additional  contribution  from  those  fields  is 
close  to  500  kb/d  between  2015  and  2020.  Beyond  2015,  Russia  has  a  substantial 
potential to develop new projects, with numerous fields reported to hold between 
200 and 500 million barrels. Russia has more large onshore fields than any region bar 
the  Middle  East.  Nonetheless,  relatively  rapid  declines  in  mature  fields  in  western 
Siberia  and  the  Volga-Ural  region  are  expected  to  offset  the  production  increases 
from new developments. Long-term production prospects depend to a large extent 
on government licensing and fiscal policies, as well as on how quickly investment in 
pipeline and export infrastructure is forthcoming. Recent fiscal changes are expected

11
to stimulate more upstream investment, but are not sufficient to sustain production 
growth in the longer term. We project total Russian oil output to drop to 9.5 mb/d in 
2030, after peaking at 10.4 mb/d around 2015.
In other Eurasian countries, new export routes are expected to stimulate production 
growth. In Kazakhstan, there is potential for growth at the three main fields, Tengiz, 
Kashagan  and  Karachaganak.  Capacity  expansions  at  the  Tengiz  and  Karachaganak 
fields, with combined reserves of more than 3 billion barrels, add about 500 kb/d 
of peak capacity. When the Kashagan field comes on line (at the earliest in 2013), 
combined  production  from  these  three  fields  reaches  more  than  1.5  mb/d,  with 
Kazakhstan entering the small group of countries producing more than 2 mb/d. 
Production from new oilfield developments in China will not be sufficient to offset 
declining  production  from  mature  onshore  areas,  including  the  super-giant  Daqing 
field, which has been in production since the 1960s. Production from the Changqing 
area, Tarim Basin and Xinjiang is expected to remain flat or grow modestly in the near 
term. Chinese production dips to 3.3 mb/d in 2015 but rebounds to 3.5 mb/d by 2030. 
Output is expected to be broadly flat in the rest of Asia through to the end of the 
current  decade  and  to  decline  thereafter.  Recent  discoveries  in  India,  however, 
including  the  Mangala  (430  million  barrels),  Bhagyama  (150  million  barrels)  and 
Aishwariya (105 million barrels) fields, delay the decline until 2015. These three fields 
produce between 100 and 150 kb/d from 2012 to 2020. Rehabilitation of the Bombay 
High  field  in  India  will  also  contribute.  Some  new  developments  are  expected  in 
Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, boosting their collective output marginally. 
Prospects for non-OPEC African countries are good to 2010, but production declines 
thereafter, to 1.7 mb/d in 2030, down from 2.3 mb/d today. Côte d’Ivoire, Republic 
of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Sudan are expected to achieve higher output through 
to 2010 (see Chapter 15). The most significant project in these countries is the Moho-
Bilondo in Republic of Congo, which is projected to produce about 100 kb/d at plateau 
in  the  next  three  years.  Further  production  growth  will  depend  on  the  success  of 
exploration and appraisal drilling in firming up reserves, and on how favourable the 
investment and legislative frameworks are. 
Production in Latin America is projected to grow from 3.5 mb/d in 2007 to 5 mb/d 
in 2015 and then to fall to 4.5 mb/d in 2030. Brazil, the region’s largest non-OPEC 
producer,  has  proven  oil  reserves  of  8.5  billion  barrels  (not  including  some  large 
recent finds that have yet to be officially confirmed) and huge potential for further 
discoveries. After a first pilot phase, which is projected to see production reaching 
about 100 kb/d before 2015, the giant Tupi field discovered in 2006 is assumed to reach 
plateau production of 1 mb/d before 2020, assuming that the technical challenges 
in producing oil from the sub-salt layer can be overcome (see Chapter 9). Ultimate 
capacity  could  be  higher,  depending  on  ultimate  recoverable  reserves  (currently 
estimated tentatively at 5 to 8 billion barrels). Other fields, including the Jupiter and 
Carioca fields announced in 2008, could add to production eventually, though further 
appraisal work is needed before formal development plans can be prepared. In the 
shorter term, 13 fields, including the Papa-Terra, Marlim Leste, Marlim Sul, Jubarte, 
Cachalote  and  Jabuti,  holding  between  300  and  700  million  barrels,  are  currently

being developed. Each of these fields is due to start producing between 50 kb/d and
200 kb/d before 2015. They add about 1.3 mb/d to Brazilian production around 2015. 
Brazil alone holds more than 20% of the total non-OPEC offshore reserves that are 
expected to be developed over the medium term.
OPEC production
OPEC crude oil and NGL supply increases from 36 mb/d in 2007 to 44 mb/d in 2015 
and to 52 mb/d in 2030 (Table 11.4). These projections assume that oil prices remain 
high by historical standards. By 2030, OPEC countries account for 51% of world oil 
production. Crude oil production increases from 31.1 mb/d in 2007 to 38.9 mb/d in 
2030. EOR projects contribute 2.8 mb/d to this increase: 1.2 mb/d in Saudi Arabia, 
800 kb/d in Kuwait, 320 kb/d in the United Arab Emirates, 240 kb/d in Qatar and
210 kb/d in Algeria. EOR is projected to provide one-third of the net increase in 
OPEC crude oil output. Offshore OPEC production declines, from around 9 mb/d in 
2007 to 7.4 mb/d in 2030, after peaking at just below 11 mb/d around 2015. Onshore 
production (including EOR) is projected to increase from 22 mb/d in 2007 to 32 mb/d 
in 2030.

In OPEC countries, a decline occurs in output from existing fields of about 17 mb/d, 
from 31 mb/d in 2007 to less than 15 mb/d in 2030 (excluding the impact of EOR). 
Output  from  existing  onshore  fields  drops  by  one-half  and  from  offshore  fields  by 
three-quarters. These production losses are made good mainly by output from known 
fields yet to be developed. Production in these fields, however, is expected to peak 
at about 14 mb/d in 2020 and to fall back to 11 mb/d by 2030. Yet-to-be-found fields 
produce about 1 mb/d in 2015 and 11 mb/d in 2030. Whether the investment needed 
to bring these fields into production will be made is one of the biggest uncertainties in 
this Outlook. 
Output  of  OPEC  NGLs  is  projected  to  triple,  from  almost  5  mb/d  in  2007  to  over
13 mb/d in 2030, reflecting huge upstream gas developments to meet rapidly rising 
domestic demand and to supply new LNG projects. Non-conventional oil is expected to 
remain very limited. Excluding extra-heavy oil in Venezuela, 6  total output is projected 
to grow from 0.1 mb/d to 0.9 mb/d in 2030. The main contribution to non-conventional 
OPEC oil production comes from Middle East countries, specifically extra-heavy oil in 
Kuwait (0.6 mb/d) and GTL in Qatar (about 0.2 mb/d).

There  are  101  upstream  oil  projects  currently  under  development  and  planned  in 
OPEC countries as a whole, involving an estimated 48 billion barrels of proven and 
probable reserves. Of these projects, 56 are onshore, involving about 28 billion barrels 
of reserves. The largest element of new production is due to come from Saudi Arabia, 
which will bring four new onshore fields into production (see below). In the longer 
term, there is considerable potential for other known onshore fields to be brought 
into  production  —  in  stark  contrast  to  the  situation  in  most  non-OPEC  countries. 
There are more than 100 onshore fields awaiting development, each holding more 
than 100 million barrels and with combined reserves of more than 50 billion barrels. 
The bulk of them are in just three countries: Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. Two-thirds 
of those reserves are concentrated in about 30 giant fields (each holding more than 
6.  In this Outlook, extra-heavy Venezuelan crude oil is categorised as conventional oil.

500 million barrels), including Sharar, Niban, Jaladi, Dhib and Lugfah fields in Saudi 
Arabia, Halfayah, Hamrin, Tuba and Ratawi fields in Iraq, and Hosseinieh, Kuskh and 
Kuh-I-Mand fields in Iran. We project that 70 fields in these three countries will be 
brought into production before 2030. Their development costs per barrel of production 
are on average the lowest in the world.
Over the next five to six years, 45 offshore projects are either under development or 
firmly planned in OPEC countries, totalling 20 billion barrels. The largest project by far 
is the Manifa field in Saudi Arabia, accounting for one-quarter of these reserves. This 
field is expected to come on line in 2012 and will produce close to 1 mb/d when the 
plateau is reached about three years later. Angola and Nigeria together account for 
two-thirds of the remaining 15 billion barrels. Nigeria ranks second in terms of total 
reserves developed over the medium term, with about 5 billion barrels in 11 projects, 
all of which involve more than 500 million barrels of reserves. Other large projects 
include Corocoro (450 million barrels) in Venezuela, Reshadat and phases 9 & 10 of 
South Pars in Iran (400 million barrels each), phase 2 of the Al Khaleej project in Qatar
(380 million barrels) and Jeruk 2 (280 million barrels) in Indonesia. No new developments 
in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  are  expected  in  the  medium  term  but  expansions  of 
existing  fields  such  as  Upper  Zakum,  Lower  Zakum,  Umm  Shaif  and  Rumaitha  are 
planned there. Several other offshore fields that are awaiting development could be 
brought on line before 2030. The offshore fields in OPEC Middle East countries generally 
are more economic to develop than those in other OPEC countries as they are mainly 
in shallow water and their average size is high (about three to four times higher than 
in Angola and Nigeria).
Saudi  Arabia  will  continue  to  play  a  vital  role  in  balancing  the  global  oil  market. 
Its willingness to make timely investments in oil-production capacity will be a key 
determinant of future price trends. Five major onshore projects, Khurais, Khursaniyah, 
Hawiyah, Shaybah and Nuayyim, which collectively hold 13 billion barrels of reserves, 
are all in the final phases of development and are projected to provide a total gross 
capacity addition of close to 3 mb/d by 2015. Expansions of the Zuluf, Safaniyah and 
Berri  fields  could  give  further  momentum  to  Saudi  Arabian  production. 7   There  are
6.2 billion barrels of reserves in 11 other known fields in Saudi Arabia that have yet 
to be developed — the highest in the world. Each of them holds reserves of at least
150  million  barrels  and  the  average  is  450  million  barrels.  The  largest  known 
undeveloped field, Hasbah 1, holds 1.8 billion barrels. Part of the increase in gross 
capacity will be offset by the decline in capacity at existing fields. Saudi Arabia aims to 
maintain spare capacity in the range of 1.5 mb/d to 2 mb/d in the long term. 
The prospects for oil production in Iraq remain very uncertain. Output is beginning 
to recover following the war in 2003. Iraqi production has always been low relative 
to the size of the country’s reserves. Iraq holds the world’s third-largest remaining 
oil reserves, after Saudi Arabia and Iran, with 115 billion barrels, according to OPEC. 
Iraq  undoubtedly  has  the  potential  to  increase  its  production  capacity  by  several 
7. At the Jeddah Summit of 22 June 2008, Oil Minister Al-Naimi said Saudi Arabia could expand capacity to 
more than 15 mb/d, subject to future market conditions. This increment was centered on ﬁ ve key ﬁ elds: 
Zuluf, Safaniyah, Berri, Khurais and Shaybah.

11
million barrels per day. On the assumption that security across the country continues 
to improve, we project production to rise steadily from 2.1 mb/d in 2007 to around 
3 mb/d in 2015 and to accelerate to 6.4 mb/d in 2030. This projection implies a five- to 
six-fold increase in investment in the upstream oil sector. Achieving this will hinge on 
political stability and providing opportunities for foreign oil companies on satisfactory 
commercial and fiscal terms.
Oil and NGL production potential in Iran is also very large. Output falls to 4.1 mb/d in 
2010, largely because of delays in implementing new projects, but recovers to 4.4 mb/d 
by 2015 and jumps to 5.4 mb/d in 2030. A total of 15 onshore projects is due to come on 
stream over the next five to six years. Leaving aside the Pars 12 and Darkhovin III fields, 
which have reserves of more than than 600 million barrels, the 13 other projects have 
reserves between 150 and 300 million barrels. Five additional projects are reported 
to  hold  less  than  100  million  barrels.  The  sum  of  the  reserves  being  developed  in 
these 20 projects ranks second among OPEC countries, with exploitation of more than
4.5 billion barrels due to start in this period. Total production from the projects, which 
are at or close to the final phase of development, is projected to reach about 1 mb/d 
on average in 2010-2020. It is nonetheless very uncertain that these production levels 
will be achieved, given limitations on investment and geopolitical factors. 
Developments in Kuwait are concentrated on the Sabriyah and the Umm Niqa fields, 
where a total of 50 kb/d of natural gas liquids capacity is being added, with completion 
expected in 2011. Another project at the Sabriyah field adds 160 kb/d of crude oil 
production by 2015. The reserves being developed are estimated to total 2.5 billion 
barrels. A water treatment project at the Greater Burgan field — the second largest 
in the world — is expected to boost gross capacity by 120 kb/d by 2009. Beyond 2020, 
we  project  Kuwait  to  develop  about  6  billion  barrels  of  heavy  and  extra-heavy  oil 
resources. In addition to the 3.3 mb/d from conventional sources in 2030, the extra
0.5  mb/d  from  those  projects  are  counted  as  non-conventional  in  our  Reference 
Scenario. Total Kuwaiti oil production is projected to reach 3.8 mb/d in 2030.
Outside the Middle East, Venezuela has the largest reserves among OPEC countries 
and the greatest long-term potential for expanding production. Several large onshore 
projects underway involve extra-heavy oil, including the Carabobo project, which we 
project to start producing by around 2015. This project produces close to 1 mb/d when 
it reaches full capacity between 2018 and 2020. Other projects, in the Junin, Petro 
Cedeno and Machete areas, target reserves of around 1 billion barrels each. Over the 
longer term, there is strong potential for new extra-heavy oil projects like Carabobo, if 
investment can be mobilised. The prospects for developments of conventional oilfields 
are much more limited. The La Ceiba onshore and Corocoro offshore fields together are 
projected to produce around 100 kb/d by around 2020.
Nigeria’s proven oil reserves are estimated at 25 billion barrels. The country produced 
2.3 mb/d of oil in 2007. In addition to the Agbami field, which started producing this 
year, several fields are currently under development, the most important of which 
are the Bonga Southwest/Aparo, Akpo, Bonga Northwest and Usan and Egina — all of 
them in deep water. They are projected to add 1.2 mb/d of gross capacity by 2015, 
boosting total production to around 3.6 mb/d (taking account of declines at existing 
fields). Investment risk in Nigeria is high, because of political instability and corruption.

276 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Nigeria is seeking an increase in its share of the OPEC production ceiling. Considering 
its huge potential and recent government reforms to oil and gas legislation, we expect 
the country to produce some 3.7 mb/d by 2030. 
Angola is leading the momentum in developing offshore production. Some 15 projects 
are expected to come on line before 2015. All but one is located in deep water. The 
combined  reserves  of  these  projects  are  5.5  billion  barrels.  Except  in  the  case  of 
the Pazflor, which alone holds some 1 billion barrels, other projects usually include 
several neighbouring fields, such as Gindungo/Canela/Gengibre and Plutao/Saturno/
Venus/Marte.  Total  production  from  this  group  of  projects  is  projected  to  reach
1 mb/d around 2012-2013. It then inches up to a bit less than 1.5 Mb/d in 2015 and dips 
below 1 mb/d beyond 2020. Offshore potential from Angola lies in 26 fields, with more 
than 50 million barrels each and total reserves of 3 billion barrels. Unless some of those 
fields are geographically close enough to be developed simultaneously, their average 
size of about 110 million barrels makes their development uncertain from an economic 
point of view, as most of them are located in deep waters.
Libya is considered a highly attractive oil province because production costs are low, 
it is close to Europe and it has well-developed infrastructure. Libya produces high-
quality, low-sulphur crude oil. Two major projects are underway: the re-development 
of the Sirte basin and an expansion of the Nafoora field. Ten smaller projects over the 
next four to five years have an average reserve level of 120 million barrels. Oil output 
in Libya is projected to increase from 1.9 mb/d now to 2.2 mb/d by 2030.
Algeria and Indonesia have the fewest and, on average, smallest current projects among 
the OPEC countries. In both countries, the biggest project involves the development 
of  about  350  million  barrels  of  reserves.  There  are  just  two  projects  underway  in 
Indonesia and three in Algeria, with combined reserves of less than 1 billion barrels.
Sensitivity of oil output to decline rates
The production decline rate that will prevail over the projection period will determine 
the extent of the need to make new investments in existing fields and new fields: the 
faster the decline-rate, the bigger the investments that will need to be made, and vice 
versa. Our Reference Scenario decline-rate assumptions are derived from a detailed 
bottom-up approach, examining the situation in each country separately on a  field-
by-field basis, and drawing on extensive consultation with the oil industry, as well 
as assumptions about production and investment policies. Nonetheless, the level of 
present decline rates and of future trends is extremely uncertain. Decline rates could 
deviate significantly from assumed trends, with major implications for oil markets.       
In order to demonstrate the importance to oil-production prospects of the decline rates 
of existing fields, and to quantify the extent to which changes in decline rates affect 
investment needs and oil prices, we have developed two variants of the Reference 
Scenario: a high decline-rate case, in which the decline rate for all fields producing 
in 2007 is assumed to be one percentage point higher than in the Reference Scenario 
throughout the projection period, and a low decline-rate case, in which the rate is

Chapter 11 - Prospects for oil production 277
11
assumed to be one percentage point lower. All other exogenous variables are assumed 
to be unchanged, including the decline-rates and production profiles of new fields. 
Crucially, we have assumed that the level of global oil supply and demand is unchanged 
over the Outlook period, in order to be able to quantify the change in price that would 
correspond to a higher or lower decline rate, and the consequent change in investment 
needs: for example, in the high decline-rate case, higher prices would be needed to 
make more projects profitable and bring forth more investment. 
The  differences  in  the  international  oil  prices  and  investment  in  the  two  cases,
vis-à-vis the Reference Scenario, are large. In the high decline-rate case, the oil price 
in 2030 is almost $20 per barrel higher than in the Reference Scenario, reaching more 
than $140 (Table 11.5). Cumulative investment in the upstream oil industry over the 
whole projection period, at $6.1 trillion, is over $1 trillion, or one-fifth, higher than in 
the Reference Scenario. The gap is already significant in the period to 2015, as more 
exploration and development spending is needed to compensate for the faster drop in 
production from existing fields.

In  the  low  decline-rate  case,  there  is  a  very  small  difference  in  2015,  compared 
with the Reference Scenario, as most of the investment over that period has already 
been sanctioned. Over the projection period, however, as the gap widens between 
production from existing fields and demand, the marginal cost of producing each barrel 
of new supplies rises, so that investment needs increase faster than the additional 
capacity needs. As discussed in detail earlier in this chapter, this reflects the change 
in the composition of the supply base in the longer term, as more offshore fields and 
more fields smaller in size than those today need to be developed.

Chapter 12 - Natural gas resources and production prospects 279
CHAPTER 12
NATURAL GAS RESOURCES AND 
PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Who will supply the world’s growing gas 
demand?
Global  proven  reserves  of  natural  gas  at  the  end  of  2007  stood  at  close  to   z
180 trillion cubic metres — equal to around 60 years of current production. Like oil, 
gas resources are highly concentrated in a small number of countries and fields. 
Three countries — Russia, Iran and Qatar — hold 56% of the world’s reserves, while 
just 25 fields hold almost half. OPEC countries also hold about half. 
Remaining  reserves  have  more  than  doubled  since  1980,  with  the  biggest   z
increases coming from the Middle East. Reserves have risen by more than 15% 
even since 2000, despite rising annual production. As with oil, the bulk of the 
increase in reserves in recent years has come from upward revisions for fields 
that have been producing or have been undergoing appraisal and development 
work. Although the size of gas discoveries has been steadily declining in recent 
decades (in the same way as for oil), discoveries continue to exceed production.
The USGS estimates remaining ultimately recoverable resources of conventional   z
natural  gas,  including  proven  reserves,  reserves  growth  and  undiscovered 
resources, at 436 tcm. Cumulative production to 2007 amounts to 13% of total 
initial resources.
Non-conventional gas resources — including coalbed methane, tight gas sands and   z
gas shales — are much larger, amounting perhaps to over 900 tcm, with 25% in the 
United States and Canada combined.
Worldwide, gas resources are more than sufficient to meet projected demand to   z
2030. The outlook for production by region depends largely on the proximity of 
reserves to markets, which primarily determines the cost of supply. Much of the 
world’s gas resources is located far from the main markets, so that only a small 
proportion of the economic potential has yet been exploited. 
In the Reference Scenario, world natural gas production is projected to rise from just   z
over 3 tcm in 2007 to 4.4 tcm in 2030. Production expands in all major regions, with the 
exception of OECD Europe, where production is already in decline, and in OECD North 
America, where output begins to dip in the second half of the Outlook period. 
Output grows most strongly, in both volume and percentage terms, in the Middle   z
East, tripling between 2007 and 2030 to 1 tcm per year. Most of this increase 
comes from Iran and Qatar. Production in Latin America and Africa also grows 
briskly. It is very uncertain whether all of the investment needed to achieve 
the projected production levels in these regions, especially the Middle East and 
Russia, will materialise.

Gas resources and reserves 
Conventional gas 
Global resources of natural gas that can be economically extracted are of a similar 
magnitude (on an energy-equivalent basis) to those of oil. Proven reserves 1  at the end 
of 2007 stood at 179 trillion cubic metres according to Cedigaz, an international centre 
for gas information, and 175 tcm according to the Oil and Gas Journal (O&GJ) — equal 
to around 60 years of current production. Other sources show similar estimates. 2  OPEC 
countries hold about half and OECD countries well under 10%. Remaining reserves have 
more than doubled since 1980, with the biggest increases coming from the Middle 
East (Figure 12.1). Reserves have risen by about 12% since 2000, despite rising annual 
production.

Natural  gas  reserves,  like  those  of  oil,  are  unevenly  dispersed  across  the  world,
being highly concentrated in a small number of countries and fields. Three countries 
— Russia, Iran and Qatar — hold 56% of the world’s remaining proven reserves, while 
just 25 fields contain 48% of the global total. The Middle East as a whole holds 41% of 
reserves and Russia alone one-quarter. Regional shares in global production are very 
different from shares in reserves: the Middle East, for example, accounts for only 11% 
of world production. North America holds only 4.5% of the world’s reserves, but 26% of 
production (Figure 12.2). These disparities largely reflect differences in the proximity 
of reserves to markets and the investment climate.

As  with  oil,  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in  proven  reserves  in  recent  years  has  come 
from upwards revisions for fields that have been producing or have been undergoing 
appraisal and development work. Nonetheless, newly discovered volumes remain large. 
Although the size of gas discoveries has been steadily declining in recent decades, 
unlike oil, volumes discovered continue to exceed production (Figure 12.3).

Estimates  of  ultimately  recoverable  conventional  resources,  including  cumulative 
production, remaining proven and probable reserves, reserves growth and undiscovered 
resources, vary widely. In its 2000 assessment, the US Geological Survey estimated

282 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
ultimately recoverable resources at at 436 tcm in its mean case (USGS, 2000). Adjusted 
for cumulative production and changes in reserves since that assessment, remaining 
resources  (including  proven  reserves,  undiscovered  resources  and  reserves  growth) 
at  end-2007  are  estimated  at  380  tcm  (2  240  billion  barrels  of  oil  equivalent),  of 
which  about  half  have  already  been  proven  (Table  12.1).  Cumulative  production 
to 2007 amounts to 13% of total initial conventional gas resources (compared with 
33%  for  conventional  oil).  These  numbers  do  not  take  account  of  the  latest  USGS 
estimates of the resource potential of the Arctic region, released in July 2008 (USGS, 
2008). According to that assessment of 25 Arctic provinces, the mean undiscovered 
gas resources are about 46 tcm (excluding NGLs), and more than 70% of the overall 
undiscovered gas potential is in three provinces (West Siberian Basin - 18 tcm; East 
Barents Basins - 9 tcm; and Arctic Alaska - 6 tcm).

Recovery rates — the share of the estimated amount of hydrocarbons initially in place 
that is economically recoverable — are significantly higher for conventional gas fields 
than for oil fields. They are thought to range from 30% to close to 100%, 3  averaging 
around 61%, based on IHS data (Laherrere, 2006). 4  Average rates are likely to increase 
with  technological  improvements,  such  as  the  increased  use  of  well-stimulation 
techniques that target stranded and bypassed pockets of gas. Use of enhanced gas 
recovery (EGR) with the injection of CO 2  from anthropogenic sources is another option, 
but this technology is in its infancy compared with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The 
world’s first pilot project of CO 2 -EGR is currently being operated by GDF Suez in the 
offshore K12B field in the Netherlands.

Box 12.1 z  Sour gas reserves: a costly nuisance?
Sour  gas  reservoirs  contain,  in  addition  to  methane,  significant  quantities  of 
hydrogen  sulphide  (H 2 S)  and/or  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 ).  More  than  40%  of  the 
world’s gas reserves are estimated to be sour (Table 12.2). In the Middle East, 
60%  of  proven  gas  reserves  are  sour.  Southeast  Asia’s  largest  gas  reservoir  is
the Indonesian Natuna field, with 1.3 tcm of gas reserves, but it has a CO 2  content 
as high as 71%. Technical difficulties have delayed Natuna’s development for 
more than two decades. 
The  presence  of  H 2 S  or  CO 2   poses  a  number  of  challenges  for  drilling  and 
production.  The  majority  of  the  completion  components  need  to  use  special 
alloys to prevent corrosion. A bigger problem is dealing with the gases produced 
and avoiding their release to the atmosphere. In the case of CO 2 , re-injection 
and  underground  storage  is  a  potential  solution  that  has  been  successfully 
implemented. The Norwegian Sleipner project and the Algerian In-Salah project 
each store over 1 million tonnes of the gas each year. In 2008, the Snohvit project 
started  injecting  0.7  million  tonnes  of  CO 2   per  year  into  storage,  while  the 
planned Australian Gorgon project plans similar procedures to avoid emissions of 
more than 3 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent per year by 2010. Carbon capture 
and storage (CCS) in gas production is a near-term opportunity to demonstrate 
the  CCS  technology,  as  the  cost  of  capture  of  CO 2   from  natural  gas  streams 
is  significantly  lower  than  from  the  flue  gases  of  power  stations  (IEA,  2008). 
The  cost  of  separating  (from  gas  production),  compressing,  transporting  and 
re-injecting CO 2  is site-specific (generally in the range of $5 to $20 per tonne
of CO 2 ).

284 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Non-conventional gas
Non-conventional gas embraces a set of gas resources that are generally contiguous 
in  nature,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “resource  plays”  in  the  industry,  that  require 
special drilling and stimulation techniques to release the gas from the formations in 
which they occur. Non-conventional gas includes coalbed methane, tight gas sands 
and gas shales. Such resources are widespread worldwide, but their development has 
generally been limited so far to North America. Determining the amount of gas in place 
in non-conventional reservoirs is a complex task, due to the heterogeneous structure 
of the reservoirs and of the production profiles, which can differ significantly from 
conventional wells. Total worldwide non-conventional gas resources are estimated at 
over 900 tcm, with 25% in the United States and Canada combined, and 15% each in 
China, India and the Former Soviet Union. 
Non-conventional gas accounts for a significant and rising share of US gas production. 
Eight of the ten largest onshore gas fields discovered in the United States in the 1990s 
were non-conventional reservoirs, including the 1-tcm Newark East Barnett Shale and 
the Powder River coalbed methane deposits. The US Energy Information Administration 
projects that the share of gas production from non-conventional resources in total 
domestic production will increase from 40% in 2004 to 50% in 2030, with this gas making 
up 28% of the US natural gas supply increase between 2004 and 2030 (DOE/EIA, 2007). 
Tight gas sands 
Tight  gas  sands  are  generally  defined  as  natural  gas  reservoirs  with  a  continuous 
accumulation system 5  and low permeability. World tight gas sand recoverable reserves 
are estimated at 200 tcm, with the largest quantities in the Americas (38%), Asia-Pacific 
(25%), the Former Soviet Union (13%), the Middle East and North Africa combined, and 
sub-Saharan Africa (11% each). The United States (principally) and Canada have been 
the leaders in tight gas sands development. In the United States in 2006, tight gas sands 
accounted for 40% of all the gas wells drilled and nearly 30% of total gas production. 
Although the number of tight gas sands wells drilled per year and production have been 
rising rapidly over the last decade in the United States (Figure 12.4), productivity, 
measured by gas reserves per well, has fallen by half. As a result, drilling activity 
needs to continue to rise if production is to be sustained. That factor, compounded by 
increasing upstream costs (see Chapter 13), has led to a near-quadrupling of production 
cost per unit of gas in the last five years.
Coalbed methane
The majority of the world’s coal resources, estimated at 86 to 283 tcm (Creedy and 
Tilley,  2003),  are  found  at  depths  where  coal  cannot  be  mined.  Coalbed  methane 
is the methane contained in coalbeds that, due to the deposit’s depth or the coal’s
poor  quality,  cannot  be  mined.  In  operating  coal  mines,  methane  gas  is  generally 
considered to be a hazard, as well as creating an environmental problem if vented to
5. An accumulation that is pervasive through a large and continuous area.

the atmosphere. Coalbed methane can be produced with well-bore technologies 
that are similar to those used for conventional hydrocarbons. However, production 
can  be  difficult  where  the  formations  are  tight,  requiring  techniques  such  as 
hydraulic  fracturing  to  enhance  well  productivity.  Water  in  the  porous  space 
needs to be removed before the gas can be extracted, which may also complicate 
the production process, increasing capital costs and giving rise to environmental 
concerns.
Despite  these  difficulties,  the  contribution  of  coalbed  methane  to  natural  gas 
supply  is  growing  rapidly  in  the  United  States.  Commercial  coalbed-methane 
production started there in the late 1980s, spurred by tax incentives, and grew with 
new  technologies  and  expansion  to  new  basins.  Advances  in  seismic  technology, 
horizontal well drilling, hydraulic fracturing and basin modelling have helped reduce 
uncertainties over the assessment of reserves and their commercial exploitation. US 
production has expanded from the original San Juan Basin to several new basins in 
Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming, reaching 1.8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) (50 bcm) in 
2006 and accounting for nearly 10% of US non-associated gas production. 
Coalbed-methane  production  is  also  expanding  outside  the  United  States.  In 
Canada, large resources are located in the Mannville, Ardley and Horseshoe Canyon 
formations. Over 10 500 wells had been drilled by early 2007 and production is 
expected to exceed 0.3 tcf (8.5 bcm) in 2008, making up more than 5% of Canada’s 
total gas production. In Australia, commercial production started in Queensland 
in  1998  and  in  2005  supplied  more  than  7%  of  the  country’s  total  gas  needs. 
It  is  projected  to  provide  35%  to  50%  of  Eastern  Australia’s  gas  needs  by  2020 
(Geoscience,  2008).  International  oil  companies,  including  Shell,  Petronas  and 
BG, have acquired coalbed-methane assets in Australia, some with the intention 
of exporting the gas as LNG. India is expected to produce up to 0.1 tcf (2.8 bcm) 
by 2010, accounting for nearly 5% of total Indian gas production. The Indonesian

government hopes to develop the country’s coalbed-methane resources, offering 
better terms for production-sharing agreements than for conventional natural gas 
projects. 
Coalbed methane has been slower to take off in China, even though the country has 
the world’s third-largest reserves and despite the large amounts of methane released 
through venting from coal mines (estimated at over 0.2 tcf, or 5.7 bcm, per year) 
and the associated safety and environmental risks. Increasing production is a priority 
in  China’s  11 th   five-year  national  plan  (2006-2010),  with  the  stated  objective  of 
producing nearly 0.3 tcf — 8.5 bcm — by 2010. Russia has over 80 tcm of recoverable 
coalbed-methane reserves, including more than 10 tcm in the Kuzbass basin, located 
at a depth of less than 1 200 metres. A few experimental projects have been started 
by  Promgaz,  a  subsidiary  of  Gazprom,  but  production  remains  negligible.  Other 
countries interested in developing their coalbed-methane reserves include Ukraine 
and Romania. 
Box 12.2 z  CO 2 -enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) production: 
a dual benefit? 
The injection of CO 2  into deep unmineable coal seams — a technology known as 
CO 2 -enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) — can produce a double benefit: it can 
enhance production of coalbed methane and store CO 2 . The first application has 
been under consideration, along with nitrogen injection, for more than a decade. 
CO 2   is  preferentially  adsorbed 6   in  coal  (compared  to  CH
4
),  because  fractures 
in the structure of the coal can absorb twice as much CO 2  as the methane it 
initially contained. Recent studies have shown that some low-quality coals in the 
United States could store five to ten times as much CO 2  as the initial methane 
(Mastalerz, 2004). 
Estimates  for  CO 2   storage  using  ECBM  range  from  150  to  220  gigatonnes  of 
CO 2  (Table 12.3). The potential is biggest in the United States and Australia. 
Between 0.1 and 0.2 tonnes of methane are expected to be recovered for each 
tonne of CO 2  injected. Commercial-scale injection of CO 2  for ECBM has been 
undertaken in the US San Juan Basin, recovering 77% to 95% of the methane in 
place. Other experimental ECBM projects have also been launched in Canada, 
China, Japan and Poland. A number of technical questions need to be addressed 
before  this  technology  can  become  commercial,  including  the  interaction 
of  CO 2   with  the  formation  rock,  which  can  reduce  permeability  and  lower 
productivity.

Shale gas: a neglected resource becomes valuable
Significant volumes of natural gas are sometimes contained in layers of shale rock, 
often hundreds of metres thick, in regions with conventional oil and gas resources. 
Until recently, producing the gas from such formations, usually discovered when drilling 
for oil and gas at deeper levels, was not profitable because of the low permeability of 
the rock. Shale gas can also occur in areas without commercial oil and gas resources. 
As exploration in those areas has been minimal, those resources may be significantly 
larger than currently thought. 
Natural gas can be stored in shales through different storage mechanisms: free gas 
in the pores of fractures and adsorbed gas. Due to the very tight nature of the shale, 
production  requires  stimulation  (hydraulic  fracturing):  in  shallow  reservoirs,  fluids 
mixed with nitrogen are often used; in deeper formations, low-viscosity fracturing fluids 
(slickwater) have replaced more expensive treatments (Frantz and Jochen, 2006). New 
methods of completing the wells involve the combined use of horizontal wells and a 
series of staged hydraulic fractures. The recent take-up of those techniques has made 
possible the development of the Barnett Shales in the United States. Recovery factors 
are expected to increase from an estimated 12% up to 50% during this decade.
Global shale-gas reserves are estimated at 450 tcm, with 35% in the Americas, 35% in 
the Asia-Pacific region and 15% in the Middle East (Rogner, 1997). The United States is 
currently the only large-scale producer, with output reaching 20 bcm in 2005. This is 
expected to rise to 28 bcm by 2010, accounting for nearly 5% of total US gas production. 
An economic analysis is underway of the potential development of shale gas in British 
Columbia, Canada: early tests with a horizontal well have achieved production rates of 
5 million cubic feet per day per well; there are plans to drill up to 20 additional wells 
by the end of 2008.

288 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Gas hydrates: are we getting closer to commercial exploitation?
Methane or gas hydrates are the most abundant source of hydrocarbon gas on earth. 
They are crystal-like solids that are formed when methane is mixed with water at low 
temperature and moderate pressure. They occur at relatively shallow depths, usually 
offshore or in Arctic regions. Various estimates of the total amount of natural gas in 
place in the hydrate accumulations have been made. The most recent estimate put 
the range for the volume of gas trapped between 2 500 tcm and 20 000 tcm, or up to 
50 times conventional reserves (see, for example, NPC, 2007). 
While the volume of hydrates contained in marine environments is several orders of 
magnitude higher than the volume in arctic permafrost regions, their concentration 
is higher in the latter. However, there are no commercial techniques yet available 
to recover them from either source. The costs could also be very high: in an offshore 
environment, capital and operation costs for a hydrate well could be at least twice 
as  high  as  those  for  conventional  gas  (RPS,  2008).  For  these  reasons,  we  do  not 
expect commercial production of gas hydrates to begin on a significant scale before 
2030.  Experimental  options  to  exploit  gas  hydrates  include  either  a  decrease  of 
reservoir pressure below the level at which the gas would separate out and heating 
the formation to the temperature at which the same effect would occur (but the 
latter would require too much energy). Commercial exploitation of hydrates with 
minimal environmental impact requires a good understanding of the processes by 
which they were laid down, technologies to identify accumulations, and analysis of 
the interaction between their production and the rock structure. 
Arctic hydrates are mostly found beneath and within permafrost in the Canadian 
Arctic,  the  North  Slope  of  Alaska  and  Siberia.  Their  presence  offshore  has  been 
confirmed,  through  multi-party  efforts  such  as  the  International  Offshore  Drilling 
Program, principally in the Americas, Norway, Russia and Japan (Figure 12.5). R&D 
on hydrates development and production has been carried out principally in Japan, 
Canada, Korea, the United States, China and India, and involves expenditure of some 
$200 million per year. In an experimental programme in the Nankai Trough, offshore 
Japan,  measurements  have  been  carried  out  to  determine  the  properties  of  gas 
hydrates and the sediments where they are found. A joint Japanese/Canadian/US 
project in the MacKenzie Delta in the Canadian Arctic, launched in the late 1990s, led 
to the world’s first consistent and steady flow of gas following the depressurisation 
of gas hydrates. In March 2008, the Mallik well in northern Canada produced methane 
for six days, at a rate comparable to a coalbed-methane well (2 000 to 4 000 cubic 
metres per day). 
China and India have also been conducting active hydrate research and development 
programmes. In 2007, a 2- to 15-metre layer of gas hydrate was discovered under 
the seabed of the South China Sea by the Chinese Guangzhou Marine Geological 
Survey.  It  may  be  possible  to  exploit  this  gas  using  conventional  technologies, 
including the use of CO 2  to displace methane. A major national programme in India 
has led to the discovery of a 130-metre thick layer of methane hydrates in the 
Krishna-Godavarie basin.

Gas production prospects
Worldwide, natural gas resources are more than sufficient to meet projected demand 
to  2030.  Nonetheless,  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  entire  infrastructure  needed  to 
develop  those  resources  and  transport  the  gas  from  the  resource-rich  countries  to 
the main centres of demand can be built in the face of economic, geopolitical and 
technical barriers — often referred to as “above-ground risks” (see Chapter 13). The 
first determinant of potential production by region is the size of the resource base 
and its proximity to markets, which affects the cost of supply. Gas transportation, 
whether by pipeline or as LNG, is very expensive when compared with oil or coal, 
and has become even more so in recent years with rampant cost inflation. Transport 
usually represents the largest share of the total cost of gas supply, especially to small 
consumers. Much of the world’s gas resources are located far from the main markets, 
so that only a small proportion can as yet be exploited profitably. 
In the Reference Scenario, world natural gas production is projected to rise from just 
under 3 tcm in 2006 (and just over 3 tcm in 2007, according to provisional data) to 
4.4 tcm in 2030 (Table 12.4). Production expands in all major WEO regions, with the 
exception of OECD Europe, where production is already in decline, and in OECD North 
America, where production begins to fall over the second half of the Outlook period. 
Output grows most strongly in both volume and percentage terms in the Middle East, 
tripling between 2006 and 2030 to 1 tcm. Most of this increase comes from Iran and

Qatar, which, alongside Russia, hold the largest reserves. Indeed, Iran sees the biggest 
volume increase of any country in the world (Figure 12.6). Most of the incremental 
output in the Middle East will be exported to North America, Europe and Asia, where 
indigenous output will not keep pace with demand. Production in Latin America and 
Africa also grows strongly.

Regional trends
OECD North America
Canada and the United States form the largest integrated natural gas market in 
the world, with Canada providing about a quarter of their combined production, 
while there is a limited amount of trade between Mexico and the United States. 
Proven reserves in the entire region are currently estimated to be 8 tcm or 4.5% 
of the world total. 7  The North American market is very mature, with the proven 
reserves equal to about only 10 years of production at current rates. In total, the 
region’s combined gas production is projected in the Reference Scenario to peak by 
7.  Unless otherwise stated, all of the ﬁ gures for proven reserves cited in this section are from Cedigaz 
(2008) and correspond to end-2007.

around the middle of the next decade and then decline gradually through to 2030. 
A steady rise in Mexican production is insufficient to offset declines in Canada and 
the United States. 
Canada’s production, 60% of which is exported to the United States, appears to be 
close to reaching a plateau. Conventional gas reserves in Western Canada represent 
almost  a  third  of  the  remaining  resource  base  and  the  National  Energy  Board  of 
Canada expects this region to be the source of almost 80% of projected Canadian 
natural gas production in the medium term. The region also contains significant non-
conventional natural gas resources, estimated at 15% of the national total, including 
coalbed methane, tight gas and shale gas (see section above). Further reserves in 
frontier areas, including the Arctic, account for more than half of Canada’s remaining 
ultimately  recoverable  gas  resources.  However,  it  is  unlikely  that  these  frontier 
reserves will contribute to production before 2030. Significant volumes of discovered 
gas are associated with offshore oil projects close to Newfoundland, but this gas is 
expected to be used to maintain reservoir pressure until oil production reaches an 
uneconomically low level.
In the United States, proven remaining reserves of gas have increased almost every 
year for the last decade and, at 6 tcm, now cover almost 11 years of production at 
current rates. Recent drilling trends point to continued growth in reserves, with a 
stronger concentration on non-conventional resources, notably shales and coalbed 
methane. Shale formations in the lower 48 states are widely distributed, large, 
and contain huge resources of natural gas (as discussed in the previous section). 
Commercial development began only recently, yet just one field in Texas — the 
Barnett Shale — already contributes more than 6% of all production from the lower 
48 states, a volume bigger than that from Louisiana, a traditional large producer 
state. 
The  combination  of  improved  technology  and  higher  gas  prices  has  stimulated 
production of deepwater and non-conventional resources, which have previously been 
too difficult and costly to extract. Sustained high gas prices in the last few years have 
resulted in higher levels of gas drilling and a trend away from drilling simple vertical 
wells to horizontal wells. These trends have helped to compensate for a continued 
decline in production from shallow-water areas in the Gulf of Mexico — output fell 
in 2007 for the sixth consecutive year — and falls in production in some other major 
producing states, including New Mexico and Louisiana. Thanks to big increases in 
output in Texas and Oklahoma, production in the first quarter of 2008 was 9% up on a 
year earlier. In the Reference Scenario, assumed high prices drive modest increases 
in US gas production in the medium term, but rising costs and dwindling reserves 
lead to a gradual decline in output over the second half of the projection period. 
The emergence of Alaska as a significant producing region, on the assumption that 
a pipeline to connect with the network in western Canada and the United States is 
built, is not sufficient to compensate for lower output in the lower 48 states. Nor can 
imports from Canada make good the remaining shortfall, so imports from outside the 
region (in the form of LNG) and possibly from Mexico grow through the projection 
period (Figure 12.7).

OECD Europe
European gas production peaked in 2004 at close to 330 bcm and is now in long-term 
decline. Continued growth in Norway has not been sufficient to offset a rapid decline 
in output in the United Kingdom, for many years Europe’s largest producer, despite 
a recent surge in drilling for gas in the North Sea. In aggregate, production in OECD 
Europe in the Reference Scenario is projected to decline steadily from 305 bcm in 2006 
to 282 bcm in 2015 and 217 bcm in 2030 — a fall of one-third on current levels. 
Norway is Europe’s leading gas producer and the sixth-largest in the world — though 
it holds just 3 tcm, or 1.7% of the world’s remaining proven reserves. The ultimate 
recoverable  resource  potential  is  thought  to  be  large,  however,  as  large  parts  of 
continental shelf have yet to be explored, especially the Barents Sea. The Norwegian 
Petroleum Directorate estimates that ultimately recoverable resources are in the range 
of 3.4 tcm to 6.6 tcm. However, despite their obvious potential, northern Norwegian 
reserves  present  a  significant  challenge,  firstly  due  to  their  remoteness  and  the 
arctic  conditions  but  also  to  the  distance  from  the  existing  transport  infrastructure 
and  traditional  markets.  Production  of  natural  gas  started  on  the  Norwegian  shelf 
simultaneously with oil production in 1971 and exports began in 1977. Norway currently 
has capacity to export about 120 bcm per year, though marketed production in 2007 
reached only 91 bcm, according to preliminary estimates. Output is projected to continue 
to grow, to over 120 bcm by 2015, and then level off at close to 130 bcm in 2030.
Large-scale  extraction  of  oil  and  gas  from  the  United  Kingdom  Continental  Shelf 
began in the late 1970s. Production of both, however, is in decline and the United 
Kingdom became a net importer of gas on an annual basis in 2004. Output has already 
dropped by a third from its peak of 113 bcm in 2001. Proven reserves, at just under 
650 bcm, would support production at current rates for less than 12 years. In recent 
years,  the  UK  government  and  industry  have  launched  a  number  of  initiatives  to 
help increase investment in long-term offshore projects, from improving access to 
pipelines  and  other  infrastructure  to  ensuring  activity  in  all  areas  under  licence. 
These are proving successful. For example, the 2005 licensing round evoked more

interest than any other round since gas production started in 1964. Monthly data 
shows  a  slowing  of  the  rate  of  decline  in  production  in  early  2008.  Nonetheless, 
increased drilling is expected only to slow, rather than halt, the long-term downward 
trend in production. We project output to reach 44 bcm in 2015 and then fall to only 
10 bcm in 2030.
The Netherlands holds the second-largest gas reserves in western Europe (1.25 tcm), 
the bulk of them in the Groningen gas field. Around two-thirds of its production, 
which amounted to 77 bcm in 2007, is exported. Proven reserves have been in gradual 
decline for several years: as Groningen has depleted, the portfolio of small fields has 
matured and discoveries have dropped off. In order to reverse this downward trend 
and to extend the life expectancy of the highly flexible (and valuable) Groningen 
field,  the  Dutch  government  has  adopted  several  measures,  including  imposing 
a ceiling on output over discrete periods. Over the period 2006-2015, the field is 
allowed to produce 425 bcm. The government has also tried to stimulate exploration 
and  production  activity  by  improving  access  to  information,  tackling  the  issue  of 
“sleeping” licences (for which no detailed development plan has been put forward) 
and making active approaches to exploration companies. These measures, together 
with higher prices have led to increased exploration, which is expected to temper the 
decline in output in the next few years. Nonetheless, production falls progressively 
more quickly through the projection period, reaching little more than 50 bcm in 2030 
— a third down on 2007. 
OECD Oceania
Natural  gas  reserves  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  stand  at  2.5  tcm,  the  bulk  of 
which  are  located  in  remote  locations  in  offshore  Western  Australia.  In  addition 
to  conventional  natural  gas,  Australia  has  extensive  deposits  of  coalbed  methane. 
Australia is fast becoming an important LNG player in the Asia-Pacific region, helping 
to compensate for Indonesia’s declining role as an exporter of LNG. Australia’s Santos 
recently announced its proposed Gladstone LNG project is for a 3 to 4 million tonnes 
per year LNG processing train and associated infrastructure, based on coalbed methane 
from Queensland’s Bowen and Surat Basins, the first of its kind. The project aims to 
export its first shipment by 2014. Total Australian production is projected to double by 
2030, to close to 100 bcm from less than 50 bcm in 2007. New Zealand production is 
expected to remain modest.
Eastern Europe/Eurasia
Russia  has  48  tcm  of  proven  gas  reserves,  one-quarter  of  the  world  total  and 
the  largest  share  of  any  country.  The  USGS  estimates  undiscovered  recoverable 
conventional  resources,  not  including  reserves  growth,  at  80  tcm,  including  an 
estimated 37 tcm located north of the Arctic Circle (USGS, 2000 and 2008). Russia 
is the world’s largest natural gas producer and exporter, and is the second-largest 
natural gas consumer after the United States. Russian exports meet almost a quarter 
of OECD Europe’s gas needs, directly to Finland and Turkey, and via transit pipelines 
through Ukraine or Belarus.

Russia’s resources are unquestionably large enough to support continuing long-term 
growth in production. But there are doubts about the cost of developing those resources 
and  the  speed  with  which  Gazprom,  the  dominant  gas  producer,  and  independent 
companies can proceed. Gazprom reported reserves replacements in 2007 of 585 bcm 
— 6% more than it produced and the third year in a row in which it was able to replace 
all its production. But during the previous ten years, the reserves replacement ratio was 
only around 50% to 70%. The Russian gas industry is at a cross-roads as production shifts 
from the super-giant fields that have accounted for most of the country’s output for 
decades — notably Urengoye, Yamburg, Medvezhye and more recently Zapolyarnoye — 
to fields located in new, more difficult-to-develop regions, needing new transportation 
infrastructure. 
Gazprom has begun development work on the 4-tcm Bovanenkovskoye field, the first 
to be brought into production on the Yamal peninsula in northern Siberia. Production is 
due to begin around 2012, with output expected to reach 115 bcm per year once a new 
pipeline is built to link the field to the national transmission system. Other Yamal fields 
are lined up for development. Yamal presents major technical challenges because of 
its extreme climate and permafrost, making it difficult to stabilise infrastructure. The 
annual operational window for getting equipment to the construction site is also very 
tight. Furthermore, new warmer climate trends are affecting construction plans, often 
requiring new project design, which needs to be tested before being put in place, causing 
delays to project timelines. Given these difficulties and the scale of the project, many 
industry observers believe that the project may not be commissioned on time. 
Gazprom, in partnership with Total and StatoilHydro, also plans to bring the 3.8-tcm 
Shtokman field, which is located offshore in the Barents Sea, into production by 2012. 
Production is planned to reach 40 bcm per year at plateau in the first two phases of the 
field’s development and 70 bcm after one or two more phases. Development of this 
field also faces major technical hurdles, as the field is located 550 kilometres offshore 
in water prone to ice-floes. A long-distance pipeline to European markets will also need 
to be built. Total development costs have ballooned to more than $40 billion for the 
first two phases. We assume that first gas comes after 2015. 
In the Reference Scenario, Russian gas production is projected to rise from 680 bcm in 
2007 to about 710 bcm in 2015 and just under 800 bcm in 2030 — an overall increase 
of just under one-fifth. There are enormous uncertainties about the mobilisation of 
the massive investments needed to develop these new fields and build pipelines to 
connect them to the domestic network and export systems. Gazprom has increased 
its  capital  spending  programme  for  2008  to  around  $35  billion,  of  which  about
$22 billion is earmarked for the upstream sector and pipelines. It plans to invest a total 
of $140 billion over the five years to 2012. A growing share of gas investment in Russia 
is expected to come from independent gas producers, on the assumption that their 
access to Gazprom’s transmission system is made easier. Gazprom will nonetheless 
remain the dominant producer for the foreseeable future.
Caspian region producers are expected to make a major contribution to the growth in 
gas production in the Eastern Europe/Eurasia region (Figure 12.8). The contribution 
of the Caspian region to global gas supply will depend on the level of investment in

exploration and production, and on the availability on commercial terms of reliable 
routes to international markets. Volumes available for export will also depend on the 
region’s own demand for gas, which has been growing strongly on the back of heavy 
subsidies; gas is used very inefficiently across the region.
Turkmenistan has ambitious plans to increase production and exports. Turkmenistan 
is the largest producer in Central Asia, with output of 72 bcm in 2007; its relatively 
small population (4.9 million) means that large volumes are available for export. Russia 
is currently the main importer of Turkmen gas, with smaller volumes going to Iran. 
Estimates of Turkmenistan’s natural gas reserves vary considerably, introducing a large 
element of uncertainty into projections of its future contribution to global gas supply. 
Official sources have put gas reserves in the country at more than 20 tcm, an amount 
approaching the range of proven reserves in Iran or Qatar — and far more than the 
3 tcm of proven reserves reported elsewhere (for example, BP, 2008 and O&GJ, 2007). 
The government announced in April 2008 an international audit of Turkmenistan’s gas 
reserves. The Turkmen government aims to raise production to 250 bcm per year by 
2030, but there is considerable uncertainty that the known resource base would support 
such an increase or that sufficient investment will be forthcoming. Major investment is 
required to develop new reserves to compensate for declining output from the mature 
fields that provide most of the country’s output now. We project annual production to 
rise to over 100 bcm by 2030.
Uzbekistan  is  a  major  gas  producer,  with  production  of  65  bcm  in  2007,  of  which 
11 bcm is exported, mainly to Russia. Following signs of a slowdown in oil and gas 
output  in  2005,  Uzbekistan  has  sought  to  increase  investment  in  exploration  and 
production to stem the decline in output at its mature fields and has concluded a 
number of new production-sharing agreements, predominantly with Russian and Asian 
companies. Output is projected to remain broadly flat through to 2030. Russia is likely 
to remain the most significant export market, but the construction of a gas pipeline 
from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan (and Kazakhstan) to China will open up the 
possibility of gas trade with China when it is completed in 2011 (though most of the gas 
that will flow through the line is likely to come from Turkmenistan).

Production  is  projected  to  increase  moderately  in  Kazakhstan.  Almost  all  of  the 
gas produced there is associated with oil production, notably from the Tengiz and 
Karachaganak projects in the west of the country. Much of this gas is re-injected, 
in order to maintain reservoir pressure and enhance oil output, or flared for lack of 
infrastructure to transport it to market. Most of the gas produced in Kazakhstan is 
consumed domestically. Annual gas production is projected to increase from 26 bcm 
in 2006 to around 40 bcm by 2015 and close to 50 bcm by 2030. Gas production in 
Azerbaijan is also set to grow, with the offshore Shah Deniz field making a sizable 
contribution, providing up to 20 bcm per year for export to Turkey and other European 
countries from the middle of the next decade.
Non-OECD Asia
Asia is a small producer and consumer of gas relative to the size of its population and 
its overall energy use. The region as a whole is a net exporter, though some countries 
— including China and India — need to import some or all of the gas they consume. 
Asian gas production — most of which is consumed locally — amounted to 341 bcm in 
2007 (little more than half that of Russia), having grown by 95 bcm, or 39%, since 2000. 
Annual output rates are projected to expand further, to around 450 bcm in 2015 and 
530 bcm in 2030. 
Indonesia has the largest proven gas reserves in the region, estimated at 3 tcm, and 
is the largest producer. Reserves grew sharply in 2006 and 2007, with new discoveries 
(resulting from a spurt in the issue of new exploration licences) and increased appraisal 
drilling. Production has nonetheless continued to drift lower as output from the main 
fields, which have been producing for many years, declines. Total output stood at 
70 bcm in 2007. Indonesia’s difficulties in meeting its contractual commitments and 
extending  existing  contracts  as  they  expire  have  been  an  important  factor  in  the 
run-up in LNG prices in the Pacific region in recent years. There is a major geographical 
mismatch between the main demand centres in Indonesia, in Java and Bali, and the 
main reserves. Pipelines connect these demand centres to procuring areas on Natuna 
Island  and  South  Sumatra,  but  other  resource-rich  areas,  such  as  Kalimantan  and 
Papua, are not connected because of their remoteness. Due to this mismatch, LNG 
import terminals are being considered in East Java, West Java and North Sumatra. 
Exports to Southeast Asia and further afield, together with rising domestic demand, 
are expected to stimulate a modest rebound in Indonesian production through to 2030. 
There are already pipelines to its neighbours, including from West Natuna to Singapore 
and Malaysia, and from South Sumatra to Singapore. The government plans to make 
more gas available to the domestic market to replace oil, which will drive up demand 
(especially in power generation). It hopes that moves to speed up the approval process 
for  new  upstream  projects  and  more  transparent  tenders  will  encourage  greater 
participation  by  international  and  domestic  players  in  exploration  and  appraisal 
activities. We project Indonesia’s production to rise to 90 bcm in 2030.
China’s proven reserves of natural gas amount to 2.7 tcm, about a fifth of which are 
associated with oil and 90% located onshore. Most production to date has come from 
onshore associated reserves; onshore non-associated gas reserves are largely untapped.

298 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Production has been rising swiftly in recent years, reaching an estimated 68 bcm in 2007 
— more than 60% higher than in 2004. Only a small number of gas fields have reached 
their production peak and several fields with large reserves have yet to be developed, 
so there is significant potential to boost output in the short to medium term. In the 
Reference Scenario, China’s annual production is projected to reach more than 100 bcm 
by 2015 and 115 bcm by 2030, by which time output is expected to be in decline. 
Middle East
The Middle East holds around 40% of world gas reserves with Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia 
and United Arab Emirates holding the largest volumes. Gas reserves in Iran and Qatar 
alone account for nearly 30% of the world total. Yet, despite a rising trend in production 
in recent years, these two countries together account for only 5% of global production 
and the region as a whole for less than 11%, suggesting strong potential to boost supply 
in the long term, particularly in Iran. Production in the Middle East is expected to 
grow more than in any other region. In the Reference Scenario, we project Middle East 
output will jump from 318 bcm in 2007 to 480 bcm in 2015 and to 1 tcm in 2030. 
Iran remains the region’s biggest gas-producing country in the Reference Scenario, 
its production rising from an estimated 107 bcm in 2007 to over 350 bcm in 2030 — on 
the assumption that the required investment can be mobilised. The lion’s share of the 
country’s reserves, and the expected source of much of the production growth in the 
medium term, is in the Iranian part (South Pars) of the South Pars/North Dome gas/
condensate field. The combined structure is the world’s largest gasfield, with 40 to
50 tcm of reserves. More than one-third of these reserves are in the Iranian sector. 
South Pars currently accounts for about one-quarter of Iran’s total gas production and 
just under half of the country’s 28 tcm of proven reserves. 
The government has, for many years, had ambitious plans to boost production from South 
Pars and other fields to supply the rapidly growing domestic market and to export (by 
pipeline and as LNG), but developments have been delayed for technical and political 
reasons.  New  upstream  awards  have  slowed  markedly  since  2004,  due  to  changes 
in political priorities and the international isolation resulting from trade embargoes 
imposed in response to the country’s nuclear programme. A growing proportion of well-
head gas supplies has been re-injected to maintain oil production in some old fields 
which are faced with high natural decline rates (see Chapter 10). As a result, production 
growth is likely to slow significantly through to the middle of the next decade. Boosting 
capacity thereafter will depend on a resurgence in awards and the clearance of other 
obstacles in the next few years. A large-scale internal pipeline construction programme 
is underway to accommodate higher production to meet domestic demand. 
Increasing domestic demand for re-injection, power generation and end uses, however, 
is  likely  to  mean  further  delays  in  planned  gas-export  initiatives.  In  mid-2008,  Iran 
officially  postponed  two  of  the  three  LNG  developments  at  South  Pars  planned  for 
the 2010-2013 period, leaving only the domestic LNG development in place. Shell and 
Total are now discussing the prospect of LNG development linked to later phases of the 
South Pars field. China’s CNOOC and Malaysia’s SKS have held intermittent talks on LNG 
development of other fields, but no firm investment commitments have been made as

yet. In addition, prolonged negotiations about gas deliveries to the Iran-Pakistan-India 
(IPI) pipeline mean that the start date for this project is now 2013 or beyond, rather 
than the original date of 2011. 
Qatar, with proven reserves of 26 tcm, is far and away the biggest gas exporter in the 
Middle East and the region’s fastest-growing producer. We project its production to 
rise from 54 bcm in 2007 to almost 170 bcm in 2030, driven mainly by LNG exports. 
Projects currently being developed by Qatar Petroleum with foreign partners will boost 
the country’s LNG export capacity to 105 bcm per year by 2011, up from 40 bcm at end-
2007 (Table 12.5). Qatar became the world’s biggest LNG exporter in 2006 and looks set 
to retain that title well into the future. The world’s largest trains, of 10.6 bcm per year 
each, are under construction in the Qatargas and Rasgas ventures, as well as the world’s 
largest gas-to-liquids plant at the Shell/Qatar Petroleum Pearl project (70 kb/d). The 
world’s biggest GTL plant, Oryx, with a capacity of 34 kb/d, was commissioned in Qatar 
in 2006. The current raft of projects, however, has been hit by technical problems and 
cost escalation, resulting from difficulties in securing materials and services. This has 
contributed to delays of more than six months in the commissioning of the first train 
at Qatargas 2 and the postponement of Rasgas 3 to early 2009 (delays which are by 
no means unique to Qatar). Project participants believe that this will have a knock-on 
effect through the project chain.

The prospects for further growth in Qatari gas production beyond 2012 are clouded by 
the uncertainty created by a moratorium on new export projects, which was imposed 
in 2005 while the effect of existing projects on North Field reservoirs was studied.

300 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Rather than make early commitments further to boost exports, in the form of LNG, 
GTL or pipeline gas (gas is already exported to the United Arab Emirates through the 
Dolphin pipeline), Qatar may seek first to prove up more reserves through additional 
exploration and appraisal, perhaps first at greater reservoir depths in the North Field. 
The  government  is  also  concerned  about  ensuring  adequate  supplies  to  domestic 
users, including a burgeoning petrochemical sector. In 2007, gas blocks at the North 
Field assigned to a cancelled GTL project (a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum 
and ExxonMobil) were reassigned to the domestic Barzan project, which will supply 
the domestic industrial sector. 
Gas production in the United Arab Emirates is projected to grow less rapidly than in 
neighbouring states, from 46 bcm in 2007 to 72 bcm in 2030. Surging energy demand 
from industrial projects, power generation and desalination plants has led to shortages 
in the Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Although reserves are large, totalling over
6 tcm, most existing production is earmarked for re-injection at oilfields and for LNG 
exports from the country’s only plant, at Das Island in Abu Dhabi. Rising international 
gas prices have made it more attractive to develop the country’s reserves, but gas-
quality problems are holding back investment. For example, although two sour gas 
fields  at  Shah  and  Bab  have  been  put  out  to  tender  for  development  with  foreign 
contractors,  negotiations  on  the  Shah  field  have  been  hampered  by  high  costs  — 
estimated at between $4 and $5 per MBtu — because of the difficulties in accessing the 
reserves and the high sulphur content. Bab, together with an integrated gas project 
and the sour gas development at the Hail field, are expected to provide additional 
volumes, but much of these will be required for re-injection to boost production at the 
country’s ageing oilfields.
In Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco’s upstream exploration programme has continued to 
prioritise exploration for non-associated gas. Most of the 67 bcm of gas it produced in 
2007 was associated with oil. It has laid out plans to increase reserves, which now stand 
at 6 tcm, by an average 142 bcm per year over the next ten years. Some successes have 
been reported, although efforts with foreign partners in the Empty Quarter have not 
yet yielded any new reserves. Development plans are currently focused on the offshore 
Karan field, which is now due to supply some 16 bcm per year into the national gas-
gathering system from the end of 2011 — 5 bcm per year more than originally planned. 
The switch to fuel oil and crude oil in some power stations will make more gas available 
for domestic uses in the medium term. However, Saudi Arabia remains unlikely to 
consider any export of natural gas until it is certain that its own increasing needs are 
assured. We project Saudi gas production to reach almost 190 bcm in 2030. 
Africa
Three countries — Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria — account for over 90% of all the gas 
produced in Africa. In aggregate, production is projected to more than double from
206 bcm in 2007 to over 450 bcm in 2030 in the Reference Scenario — the largest 
increase in volume terms of any region bar the Middle East. The three main producers 
account  for  the  bulk  of  this  increase  in  volumetric  terms,  but  the  share  of  other 
countries, notably Libya and Equatorial Guinea, grows over the projection period.

Nigeria is expected to overtake Algeria to become the region’s biggest producer by 
2030. With an estimated 5.2 tcm of proven natural gas reserves — the fifth largest in 
the world and the largest in Africa — output is projected to reach close to 130 bcm 
in 2030, up from just over 35 bcm in 2007. More than half of the country’s marketed 
output is exported as LNG, with the remainder flared (see Chapter 15) or used for 
power  generation  and  in  industry  (there  is  no  public  distribution  network  for  the 
residential  sector).  A  large  share  of  total  output  is  used  for  oil  extraction.  Future 
production growth will be driven by both export projects and rising domestic demand, 
particularly for power generation.
With the launch of Train 6 in December 2007, the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) project, located 
on Bonny Island in the Niger Delta, reached a total LNG production capacity of 31 bcm 
per  year,  overtaking  Algeria  and  becoming  the  largest-capacity  LNG  facility  in  the 
Atlantic Basin. NLNG is investigating the possibility of adding huge seventh and eighth 
trains, of 10.9 bcm per year each, though a final investment decision has yet to be 
made. Other projects are planned. In total, capacity could reach over 60 bcm per year 
by 2015. Nigeria has also developed projects to export natural gas via pipelines. The 
West Africa Gas Pipeline project will carry natural gas from Nigeria to Benin, Togo and 
Ghana. The 678-km line was completed in December 2007 but commercial operation is 
not expected to begin until 2008, a delay of more than one year from the original target 
date at the time of the construction decision.
Algeria, with 4.5 tcm of proven gas reserves, has the potential to continue to expand 
its production to meet growing domestic demand, particularly for power generation 
and water desalination, and for export. Output is projected to rise from almost 90 bcm 
in 2007 to over 140 bcm per year by 2030. The state-owned company, Sonatrach, which 
dominates the industry, aims to achieve gas exports (by pipeline to Europe and as LNG) 
of 85 bcm in 2012 and 100 bcm in 2015, up from 62 bcm in 2007. Gas reserves in the 
Berkine Basin, as well as more difficult reserves from the southwest of the country, 
are expected to feed these projects. They will require large infrastructure investments 
around Hassi R’Mel, the country’s largest single gasfield. Further supplies are envisaged 
from  recent  exploration  successes,  which  included  20  oil  and  gas  discoveries  in 
2007. Algeria resumed licensing rounds for upstream acreage in 2008, after a hiatus 
caused by revisions to the hydrocarbon law in 2005 and 2006. Sonatrach is negotiating 
partnerships in upstream projects with companies in importing countries in Europe, 
in return for direct access to those companies’ domestic markets. Alliances have also 
been pursued with other producers, including Norway’s StatoilHydro, with an eye to 
joint developments, cargo swaps and market access (on this occasion) to StatoilHydro’s 
capacity at the US Cove Point terminal. 
Egypt, with 2.1 tcm of proven gas reserves, raised production from 22 bcm in 2000 to 
52 bcm in 2007. Most of the increase has gone to the domestic market, but exports 
have grown too, quadrupling between 2004 and 2007, following the opening of the 
Arab gas pipeline to Jordan and the commissioning of three LNG trains. Egypt does 
not permit export commitments to exceed one-third of the reserve base, in order to 
ensure adequate domestic supplies for future generations. Two new export outlets 
were opened up in early 2008, in the form of a pipeline to Israel and the extension of 
the Arab gas pipeline from Egypt through Jordan into Syria. That pipeline will be linked

into the Turkish grid in the next phase of development, although there will be limited 
volumes  of  gas  available  for  onward  delivery  in  the  near  term.  A  final  investment 
decision is still pending on a second train at the Damietta LNG plant.
Other countries are set to emerge as major producers and exporters. In Libya, the 
emphasis is on export markets: domestic consumption is expected to increase rapidly, 
but from a small base, due to the limited population and small industrial base. A 2004 
deal with Shell could lead to a new LNG project, if sufficient reserves were to be found. 
BP has also undertaken exploration commitments, with a view to locating feedgas for 
an LNG facility. ExxonMobil is actively searching for potentially exportable gas offshore. 
At the end of 2007, the only current gas exporter, Eni, committed to a ten-year deal 
which includes the further development of its Libyan fields to supply an additional 
3 bcm of gas through the 8 bcm Greenstream pipeline to Italy and construction of a 
new 5 bcm per year LNG export plant at Mellitah. The LNG deals are unlikely to yield 
significant gas exports before 2013, but do make Libya an expected player in regional 
export growth in the latter half of the next decade. The country held its first upstream 
licensing round focused specifically on gas in 2007, with a view to more than doubling 
its existing proven reserve base of 1.3 tcm.
Some other African countries are also aiming to develop LNG projects. Angola, with 
large associated gas reserves, is building its first LNG liquefaction plant in the Zaire 
province with capacity of 7 bcm per year. It is expected to be completed by early 2012. 
Equatorial Guinea began exporting LNG in 2007 from a 4 bcm per year plant. 
Latin America
Gas  production  and  consumption  in  Latin  America  remain  highly  concentrated. 
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela account for 
almost all the region’s production, most of which (with the exception of that from 
Trinidad and Tobago, which exports LNG) is consumed within the domestic market. 
Although the region has plentiful gas reserves, estimated at 7.7 tcm, the recent surge 
in producing countries of resource nationalism and government policies that discourage 
upstream investment has led some importing countries to turn to imported LNG from 
outside the region, rather than rely on overland pipeline imports from neighbouring 
countries. Today, several LNG receiving terminals are either being built or are at the 
planning stage — three in Brazil, two in Chile, one in Argentina and one in Uruguay. If 
all are built, Latin America could be importing as much as 14 bcm per year of LNG by 
the end of the decade, reaching 27 bcm per year by the end 2012.
All the main gas-resource holders are expected to see rapid growth in production. 
Venezuela,  which  has  enough  gas  resources  to  overtake  Argentina  as  the  leading 
producer in Latin America, has proven reserves of 5.1 tcm accounting for two-thirds 
of the total for the whole continent. We project its output to jump from only 25 bcm 
in 2007 to 70 bcm in 2030, though the above-ground risks to this projection are high. 
Exports of LNG are likely to drive much of the growth in the latter part of the Outlook 
period.  Brazil’s  output,  all  of  which  will  be  needed  to  meet  domestic  demand,  is 
projected to more than triple, to 38 bcm by 2030, with a sharp increase in output 
expected to come from recent offshore pre-salt finds (see Chapter 9).

CHAPTER 13
UPSTREAM INVESTMENT PROSPECTS
Are we spending enough? 
Worldwide investment in the upstream oil and gas industry has surged in nominal   z
terms in recent years, partly due to soaring costs and higher oil prices, which 
have  strengthened  incentives  to  explore  for  and  develop  reserves  in  some 
regions. Total upstream investment more than tripled between 2000 and 2007, 
from an estimated $120 billion to $390 billion. Most of this increase was due to 
higher unit costs: in cost-inflation adjusted terms, investment in 2007 was about 
70% higher than in 2000.
Based on the plans of the companies surveyed for this   z Outlook, global upstream 
oil and gas investment is expected to rise to just over $600 billion in nominal 
terms by 2012 — an increase of more than half over 2007. If costs level off, as 
assumed, real spending in the five years to 2012 would grow by 9% per year — 
about the same rate as in the previous seven years. Spending on exploration will 
remain small compared with that on field development.
The bulk of upstream investment will continue to be made by the international   z
companies. Over the period 2000-2007, the five super-majors alone accounted 
for 29% of all the upstream investment made by the companies surveyed for this 
Outlook and other international and private upstream companies for a further 
31%. These shares will not change much over the next five years or so. Much 
of the increase in this upstream spending will go to meeting rising unit costs of 
developing  dwindling  resources  in  non-OPEC  regions,  where  the  bulk  of  their 
investment is directed.
Worldwide, upstream unit costs rose on average by an estimated 90% between   z
2000 and 2007 and by a further 5% in the first half of 2008, based on the IEA 
Index of Upstream Capital Costs. Most of the increase occurred in 2004-2007. 
Exploration and development costs have risen at roughly the same rates. Taking 
account of these cost increases, overall physical upstream activity over the seven 
years to 2007 grew by about 70%, or 8% per year. 
Current projects are expected to add more than enough capacity to meet demand   z
growth and counter declines at existing fields through to 2010. But many more 
projects will need to be sanctioned (mostly within the next two years) to bridge 
the gap between the total gross capacity addition of 30 mb/d needed by 2015 
and the actual projected addition of 23 mb/d from current projects. If actual 
capacity additions fall short, spare production capacity would diminish and oil 
prices would undoubtedly rise.

304 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The Reference Scenario projections imply a need for cumulative investment in   z
the upstream oil and gas sector of around $8.4 trillion (in year-2007 dollars) over 
2007-2030, or $350 billion per year. That is significantly less than is currently 
being  spent.  But  there  is  a  major  shift  in  where  that  investment  is  needed. 
Much more capital needs to go to the resource-rich regions, notably the Middle 
East,  where  unit  costs  are  lowest.  It  is  far  from  certain  that  these  countries 
will be willing to make this investment themselves or accept sufficient foreign 
investment to make it up.
Recent investment trends and near-term outlook
Worldwide investment in upstream oil and gas has surged in nominal terms in recent 
years and, on current plans, is set to rise further in the coming years. This reflects a 
combination of higher oil prices, which have strengthened incentives for oil and gas 
companies  to  explore  for  and  develop  reserves  in  some  regions,  soaring  cash-flow 
and  rising  costs.  The  prices  of  cement,  steel  and  other  materials  used  in  building 
production facilities, the cost of fuel used in construction, the cost of hiring skilled 
personnel  and  drilling  rigs,  and  the  prices  of  oilfield  equipment  and  services  have 
soared, especially since 2003, though there are signs that costs may now be levelling 
off. Between 2000 and 2007, capital spending grew at an average rate of 18% per 
year. In 2007, total upstream investment reached an estimated $390 billion, up from 
$120 billion in the year 2000 — a more than three-fold nominal increase. The increase 
has been particularly strong since 2004 (Figure 13.1). This trend is broadly in line with 
data reported by other organisations. Most of the increase in spending since 2000 was 
needed to meet higher unit costs: in cost-inflation adjusted terms, investment in 2007 
was 70% higher than that in 2000. Box 13.1 describes the methodology used to analyse 
investment trends.

Based on the announced investment plans or forecasts by the 50 companies surveyed 
for this Outlook, total upstream oil and gas investment is expected to rise to just over 
$600 billion in nominal terms by 2012 — an increase of more than half over 2007. If 
this expectation is realised, annual investment in nominal terms would be on average 
two-and-a-half times higher in 2008-2012 than in 2000-2007. Upstream investment as a 
share of total oil and gas industry investment (including refining, oil pipelines, liquefied 
natural gas chains and gas-to-liquids) is expected to rise slightly from 68% in 2000-2007 
to 70% in 2008-2012. In cost-inflation adjusted terms, upstream spending is set to grow 
by around 50% between 2007 and 2012, assuming unit costs level off in 2008. This 
equates to 9% per year. There is little scope for the industry to increase real spending 
faster than this, even if major new investment opportunities arise, because of a lack of 
skilled labour and equipment. These investment trends should be treated as indicative 
only, as they are based on current plans, which could change were oil prices and costs 
to differ markedly from our assumptions.
Box 13.1 z  Approach to assessing the outlook for upstream investment
Our outlook for upstream investment is assessed both bottom-up and top-down. 
The former involves a detailed analysis of the plans and prospects for oil and gas 
industry investment over the period 2000 to 2015, with the aim of determining 
whether the industry is planning to invest more in response to higher prices and 
to a growing need for new capacity and of assessing the resulting additions to 
production capacity. This analysis is based on two main elements:
A survey of the capital-spending programmes of 50 of the largest upstream   z
oil  and  gas  companies  (national  and  international  companies  and  pure 
exploration  and  production  companies),  covering  actual  capital  spending 
from 2000 to 2007 and their plans or forecasts of spending through to 2012 
(Table 13.1). Companies were selected on the basis of their size as measured 
by  their  production  and  reserves,  though  geographical  spread  and  data 
availability also played a role. The surveyed companies account for close to 
80% of world oil production and 79% of oil reserves, 66% of gas production and 
71% of gas reserves. Total industry investment was calculated by adjusting 
upwards the spending of the 50 companies, according to their share of world 
oil and gas production for each year.
A review of all major upstream projects worldwide — sanctioned (approved   z
by the company board) and planned — which are due to be brought on stream 
before 2015. This review covers over 570 projects, each involving a capacity 
addition  of  more  than  5  thousand  barrels  of  oil  per  day  (kb/d).  Projects 
include conventional oil and gas production, non-conventional oil sands and 
coal- and gas-to-liquids.
Data  was  obtained  from  companies’  annual  and  financial  reports,  corporate 
presentations,  press  reports,  trade  publications  and  direct  contacts  in  the 
industry.

306 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The top-down determination of overall upstream investment needs to 2030 was 
derived from the WEO oil- and gas-supply models. These models determine the 
rate of development of new projects, based on assumptions — derived from our 
review of upstream projects — about unit capital costs which take into account 
the impact of technological change and country-specific factors. The results are 
presented in year-2007 dollars. With this approach, capital spending is attributed 
to the year in which the plant in question becomes operational, because of the 
difficulties in estimating lead-times and how they might evolve in the future. 
For both the near-term and longer-term assessments, investment is defined as 
capital expenditure only. It does not include spending that is usually classified as 
operation and maintenance.
The  bulk  of  upstream  investment  will  continue  to  be  made  by  the  international 
companies. Over the period 2000-2007, the five super-majors 1  alone accounted for 29% 
of all the upstream investment of the companies surveyed for this Outlook and other 
international and private upstream companies for a further 31% (Figure 13.2). Their 
combined share is projected to drop by just one percentage point to 59% over 2008-
2012. The share of national companies is set to rise from 40% to 41%. More than half of 
total upstream investment over the next five years will, as before, continue to go to 
maintaining output at oil and gas fields already in production. Spending on exploration 
is expected to remain small compared with that on the development of existing and 
new fields (Figure 13.3).

Capital spending on oil and gas exploration has increased substantially since 2004, but 
continued to decline as a share of total upstream spending until 2006 (Figure 13.4). In 
2007, the share fell back again, to just over 15%, down slightly on 2006 and well below 
the level of almost 20% in 2000 — despite dwindling reserve-replacement rates and a 
surge in the value of reserves. This reflects several factors: an emphasis on developing 
proven reserves in order to profit from high prices, the limited opportunities for the 
international  companies  to  explore  for  hydrocarbons  in  highly  prospective  regions 
(see Chapter 14) and shortages of rigs and manpower. The credit squeeze, as yet, has 
had little impact on upstream financing (Box 13.2).

Box 13.2 z  Impact of the credit crunch on upstream financing
The upstream oil and gas industry has weathered the credit crunch better than 
most other sectors — largely because most capital spending is financed out of 
cash-flow  and  because  those  companies  that  do  need  to  borrow  are  able  to 
secure loans against healthy balance sheets. Many national companies are also 
largely immune from tighter lending standards because of credit guarantees and 
favourable borrowing terms from their state owners. Nonetheless, smaller private 
companies  have  experienced  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  borrowing  in  recent 
months, which has encouraged some — most recently, Imperial and Cairn India 
— to raise cash through rights issues in order to limit interest charges. Others, 
including Tullow Oil, have disposed of non-core assets in order to raise funds for 
upstream developments.
In addition, project finance, commonly used for mid-stream activities such as 
LNG chains and oil and gas pipeline projects, has become more costly and harder 
to secure as a result of diminishing liquidity and increased risk-aversion among 
lenders — especially for smaller projects. Such projects are increasingly making 
use  of  export  credit  guarantees  to  facilitate  access  to  long-term  credit.  This 
tendency stems partly from an increase in the sheer size of projects and partly 
from increased uncertainty and risk. Should there be any delays and cancellations 
resulting  from  tougher  credit  terms,  these  will  inevitably  affect  the  scale  of 
development of upstream projects.

310 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
New upstream projects
The last few years have seen a big increase in nominal spending on large oil and gas 
projects (mainly new fields), particularly in the Middle East. As with overall investment, 
this largely reflects higher costs. We have identified more than 570 projects that are 
due  to  come  on  stream  over  the  period  2008-2015,  involving  total  investment  of 
about $1.4 trillion (Table 13.2). The three biggest projects currently in development 
— Kashagan (phase 1 and 2) in Kazakhstan and Sakhalin 2 and Shtokman in Russia — 
involve total investment of $114 billion. Some of the sanctioned and planned projects 
will  undoubtedly  encounter  delays  due  to  shortages  of  equipment  and  manpower. 
The average slippage in project completion has risen to more than a year (IEA, 2008). 
Examples of major projects that are falling behind schedule include Thunder Horse in 
the US Gulf of Mexico and Sakhalin-2, both of which are now expected to be completed 
only in 2008 — more than two years later than originally planned. Development of 
the Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan has been delayed by at least five years, with first 
production now due in 2013 at the earliest.
Some  41%  of  the  investment  in  current  projects,  all  of  which  are  due  to  come  on 
stream by 2015, will go to developing fields located in OECD countries (Figure 13.5). 
Less than a quarter will go to projects in OPEC countries, altough they hold two-thirds 
of the world’s resources. Oil and gas companies based in OECD countries continue to 
dominate global upstream investment. They will account for 70% of investment in new 
projects over 2008-2015. The share of total project investment made by the national 
oil companies of OPEC countries is very small, at only 9%, while those of Middle East 
OPEC countries account for 6%. Unit development costs in the Middle East are much 
lower than in most other regions.

Capital-cost trends
The cost to oil companies of exploring for and developing new fields and boosting 
output at existing fields has increased considerably since the beginning of the current 
decade.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  soaring  unit  cost  of  all  the  inputs  to  upstream 
activities, including drilling and oilfield services, skilled labour, materials and energy. 
The fall in the value of the US dollar, which has pushed up the cost of materials, 
equipment and labour sourced in countries with currencies not tied to the dollar, has 
been a major contributor to the overall surge in costs in dollar terms. A shift in spending 
towards  more  technically  complex  projects  in  locations  where  no  infrastructure 
exists, especially deepwater fields, and to smaller fields, where unit costs tend to be 
higher, has also contributed. These factors have more than offset the impact of new 
technology, which had helped to lower average unit costs in the 1990s (IEA, 2001). 
Finding and development costs per barrel — defined as exploration and development 
expenditure divided by additions to reserves — have rebounded in all regions in dollar 
terms. According to official US data for upstream companies covered by the financial 
reporting system, the three-year moving average of finding and development costs 
jumped by almost half between 2005 and 2006 (Figure 13.6). The biggest increase 
occurred in Europe, where costs doubled, partly because of the sharp rise in the value 
of the euro against the dollar. Expressed in local currencies, cost escalation in many 
regions has been much less marked, though still substantial.

Drilling is the single largest component of upstream capital spending, accounting for 
over half of the total (including exploration and development wells). Drilling costs 
have risen particularly rapidly in recent years. The average dollar cost of drilling a well 
more than doubled between 2000 and 2007, reflecting both an increase of around 90% 
in the cost per foot drilled, and a 15% increase in the average depth drilled per well 
(Figure 13.7).

A surge in day-rates for drilling rigs, 2  caused by strong demand from oil and gas field 
operators,  has  been  the  principal  reason  for  increased  drilling  costs  (Figure  13.8). 
Day-rates typically make up about half of the total cost of drilling a production well. 
Day-rates in all regions rose strongly in 2005 and, in most parts of the world, in 2006 
and 2007 too, but they have levelled off in recent months in most places. In the US Gulf 
of Mexico, day-rates for jack-up rigs have been declining steadily since the middle of 
2006, but rates for deepwater rigs have continued to rise strongly. In mid-2008, ultra-
deepwater drillships were under contract for more than $650 000 per day. Rates for 
semi-submersible rigs were approaching $500 000/day, compared with $130 000/day 
at the turn of the decade.
2.  Day-rates are the daily cost to the operator of renting the drilling rig and the associated costs of person-
nel and routine supplies. They usually do not include capital goods, such as casing and well heads, or special 
services, such as logging or cementing, but may include the cost of fuel.

Utilisation rates for both land and offshore rigs are at, or close to, 100%, as demand 
for rigs has grown. Demand for rigs and day-rates have been boosted by higher oil 
and gas prices (Figure 13.9), which have boosted returns on upstream investment. 
Higher drilling costs have, in turn, driven up the cost of developing new supplies and 
lent support to forward prices. To a large extent, the surge in day-rates for drilling 
rigs  simply  reflects  the  short-term  rigidity  of  supply  in  the  face  of  rapidly  rising 
demand.  Consequently,  rig-owners  have  seen  their  profits  rise  strongly.  But  some 
of the underlying costs typically included in day-rates for drilling services (such as 
labour) and other costs for services not included in day-rates (notably cement, well-

casings and specialist drilling services) have also risen strongly. The international price 
of steel has almost tripled since 2001, while the price of aluminium has doubled, driven 
by booming demand from China and other developing countries. The costs of hiring 
skilled personnel have also risen sharply.

Cost inflation has hit upstream projects in all regions. The average capital cost of 
projects (weighted by production) under development is estimated to have risen by 
about 50% since 2006 (Figure 13.10). At present, the cost of new capacity is highest for 
gas-to-liquids plants, at close to $110 000 per barrel per day. The Middle East remains 
the lowest-cost region, with an average capital cost for all projects of just over $10 
000/b/d.  Worldwide, upstream costs rose on average by an estimated 90% between 
2000 and 2007 and by a further 5% in the first half of 2008, based on the IEA Upstream 
Investment  Cost  Index,  or  UICI  (Box  13.3  and  Figure  13.11).  Most  of  the  increase 
occurred in 2004-2007. Exploration and development costs have risen at roughly the 
same rates. Costs have risen most for materials, products, hiring land rigs and project-
management fees, all of which have more than doubled since 2000. 
The outlook for upstream costs remains very uncertain. The extent to which the run-up 
in upstream costs is the result of structural rather than cyclical factors is unclear. Few 
people in the business expect costs to fall back to the levels prevailing at the beginning 
of the current decade, though some expect costs to retreat to some degree as physical 
capacity in the oil services and drilling industries expands in the coming years. Many 
others expect costs to continue to rise in dollar terms — barring a sharp revaluation of 
the currency — if not at the rapid pace of the last few years. What is clear is that, over 
the longer term, costs will continue to swing in response to marginal imbalances in the 
supply of and demand for drilling services and equipment.

Box 13.3 z  IEA Upstream Investment Cost Index
We  have  prepared  an  overall  index  of  upstream  capital  costs  worldwide  in 
US  dollars,  based  on  disaggregated  data  for  the  different  cost  components, 
back to 2000. The aim is to determine the average annual rate of increase in 
underlying costs incurred directly by operating companies for both exploration 
and production, stripping out the effect of shifts in spending on different types 
of upstream projects and regions as well as the impact of changes in drilling 
productivity  (e.g.  average  well  depth).  These  costs  include  the  acquisition 
of  seismic  data,  project  management,  rig  hiring,  drilling  services  and  the 
construction of production facilities (including treatment and processing plant, 
compressors, generators and gathering pipelines). The underlying costs of labour, 
materials and equipment are incorporated in charges for drilling, related services 
and facilities. 
Indices  for  exploration  and  production  are  calculated  by  weighting  the 
contribution of each component within those activities. Costs for onshore and 
offshore developments (broken down by shallow and deep water) are assessed 
separately, so that the index is not distorted by a shift in spending over time 
between these locations. The overall Upstream Investment Cost Index (UICI) is 
the average of the two separate indices for exploration and production, weighted 
by capital spending (based on the results of our survey of upstream investment). 
Our  approach  differs  from  that  used  by  IHS/CERA 3   in  preparing  its  Upstream 
Capital Costs Index, which tracks the costs of equipment, facilities, materials 
and personnel used in the construction of a geographically diversified portfolio of 
28 onshore, offshore, pipeline and LNG projects. The IEA and IHS/CERA indices 
report similar increases in costs between 2000 and 2007.

There  are  signs  that  the  pace  of  upstream  cost-inflation  is  slowing,  largely  as  a 
result of new capacity coming on line and a slowing of growth in demand for oilfield 
services and related materials. This is partly because some companies are baulking at 
high costs and are delaying investment decisions in the hope that costs will fall back 
later. Day-rates for jack-up rigs in the United States, for example, have already come 
down from peaks reached in mid-2006 (Figure 13.8, above). The surge in day-rates in 
recent years has prompted a new wave of construction of rigs, especially for offshore 
drilling (Figure 13.12). Around 160 offhsore rigs were under construction in mid-2008, 
compared with close to 140 in 2007 and fewer than 20 in 2004. Utilisation and day-rates 
are nonetheless likely to remain at historically high levels: all of the deepwater rigs 
that will come to market between now and 2010 have already been assigned to projects 
that are under development, leaving no free rigs for any new opportunities that may 
emerge in the next few years (see the Spotlight below). 
The discovery of Tupi and other large deepwater fields in Brazil has led to an increase in 
demand for heavy-duty rigs: Petrobras has announced its intention to order 26 such rigs 
in the next decade. On the other hand, new land and offshore rigs being brought into 
operation generally use more efficient technologies (such as rotary steerable systems), 
cutting the number of days needed to drill a well. This will reduce the number of rig-
days needed to find and develop hydrocarbons in the coming years. In the light of these 
uncertainties, we have assumed that costs stabilise in 2009 and remain flat in real 
terms (adjusted for consumer price inflation) thereafter.

Trends in upstream activity
Although  nominal  upstream  investment  in  dollar  terms  increased  by  about  220% 
between 2000 and 2007, we estimate that around two-thirds of this increase has been 
absorbed by cost inflation. In other words, overall physical upstream activity (actual 
spending adjusted for cost inflation using the IEA UICI) over the seven years to 2007 
grew by about 70%, or 8% per year. Activity, or real investment, was actually flat in 
2004 (Figure 13.13). On the assumption that costs increase on average by 3% in 2008 
(assuming that costs levelled off in the second half of the year at the levels reached 
in the first half) and then stabilise, current oil-company investment plans imply an 
increase in real investment of about 50% between 2007 and 2012 — again, growth of 
8% per year. Growth in real and nominal investment begins gradually to decline over 
that period.
Is strong demand leading to more drilling capacity?
Increased  capital  spending  on  exploration  and  production  in  recent  years, 
resulting largely from higher oil and gas prices, has led to a surge in demand for 
drilling rigs, especially for offshore activities. The world fleet of offshore rigs, 
including jack-ups (fixed platforms supported by rigid legs for shallow-water 
drilling), semi-submersibles (floating vessels supported by large pontoon-like 
structures submerged below the sea surface and anchored with cables to the 
seabed  in  deeper  water)  and  drillships  (used  in  very  deep  water),  has  been 
operating  at  close  to  100%  of  capacity  for  most  of  the  last  three  years  and 
backlogs of orders have grown. At present, existing ultra-deepwater rigs are 
on average contracted through to 2012, with several rigs committed to beyond 
2015. 
Strong demand for rigs has stimulated a sharp increase in the construction of 
new offshore rigs. Most of the current rig fleet of 614 vessels (the majority of 
which are jack-ups) were built in the 1970s and early 1980s: more than 450 rigs 
were delivered between 1970 and 1985. Another 40 or so were added over the 
next 12 years. Deliveries picked up at the end of the 1990s (over 40 rigs were 
added in 1998-2000 alone) and, after stalling during the first half of the current 
decade, have begun to climb rapidly once again. In mid-2008, 147 rigs (half 
of them jack-ups) were under construction, all of which are expected to be 
delivered before end-2010. Between 2000 and 2004, the average number of rigs 
under construction rarely exceeded 25. About 60 existing vessels are currently 
undergoing modification. Were this number to remain constant, the fleet of 
active offshore rigs would rise from 560 at end-2007 to about 700 at end-2010 
— an increase of one-quarter. Delays in obtaining materials may, however, slow 
this increase, as will retirement of older rigs. Almost all the new deepwater 
rigs under construction have already been contracted, in some case for several 
years.

The historic trends in real spending implied by nominal spending and the IEA UCCI are 
broadly in line with various indicators of upstream activity (Figure 13.14). That is, 
physical activity has increased much less quickly than nominal spending. For example, 
the worldwide land rig count (number of active rigs) was lower in every year from 2003-
2007 than in 2000, while the offshore rig count was only marginally higher in 2007 than 
in 2000. Total footage drilled worldwide nonetheless rose by close to 80% between 2000 
and 2007, implying a significant increase in the average depth of wells drilled. Most of 
the increase in footage drilled occurred in North America, which accounted for two-
thirds of all drilling in 2007. Production added per foot drilled in North America is far 
lower than in the rest of the world.

322 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Implications for oil-production capacity
The more than 570 upstream projects currently under construction (sanctioned) and 
planned — most of them involving new fields — will add in total around 28 mb/d of 
new peak oil-production capacity in the period to 2015, on the assumption that their 
completion is not delayed. Even though spending by their national companies amounts 
to  under  10%  of  the  global  total,  the  largest  capacity  additions  come  from  Middle 
East countries (Figure 13.15), notably Saudi Arabia (3.10 mb/d), Iran (0.99 mb/d) and 
the UAE (0.43 mb/d). The Saudi capacity increments will come from the Khursaniyah 
(500 000 b/d in 2008), Shaybah (250 000 b/d in 2008), Nuayim (100 000 b/d in 2009), 
Khurai (1.2 mb/d in 2009) and Manifa (900 000 b/d in 2011) fields. The other regions 
that will contribute the bulk of the gross capacity additions are North America (mainly 
Canadian oil sands and US Gulf of Mexico), Africa and Latin America.

The  gross  capacity  additions  from  current  projects  will,  of  course,  be  offset  to  a 
large degree by production declines at existing fields as their reserves are depleted — 
despite continuous large-scale investment (see Chapter 11). In the Reference Scenario, 
the decline in global production at existing fields is expected to total 21 mb/d between 
2007 and 2015, even allowing for new investment in existing fields. World oil demand is 
projected to grow by 9 mb/d between 2007 and 2015. Thus, an additional 30 mb/d of 
capacity over and above that currently being built or planned will need to be built to 
match the loss of production through decline and the increase in demand to 2015. 
Although the aggregate peak capacity of current projects totals 28 mb/d, they reach 
peak  at  different  times  and  then  decline,  so  the  actual  gross  cumulative  capacity 
addition in any given year will inevitably fall some way short of the aggregate. In 2010, 
gross capacity additions are expected to reach about 6.5 mb/d, slightly exceeding

13
projected demand growth. 4  But the additions to capacity from 2011 onwards begin 
to fall short of net projected demand, as fewer projects are brought on stream, and 
new projects peak and then decline. Taking account of project slippage, we estimate 
that the actual addition to capacity in 2015 (over and above the 2007 level) from 
these projects, based on the observed decline rates by region reported in Chapter 
10, amounts to 23 mb/d. 5  This means that other projects beyond those currently in 
development — most of which would need to be sanctioned within the next two to 
three years given current lead-times — would need to add a further 7 mb/d of capacity 
to offset decline and match the net growth in demand. In practice, new projects will 
undoubtedly be sanctioned. But it is by no means certain that all of the necessary 
additional capacity will be forthcoming. If actual capacity additions fall short of this 
amount, at the very least spare production capacity would be squeezed and oil prices 
would rise. 
Outlook for investment to 2030
In the longer term, upstream investment will hinge on market conditions and the policy 
and regulatory environment. While access to capital is unlikely to constitute a major 
hurdle to investment, there is considerable uncertainty about future costs, the level 
of prices needed to make new investments attractive, changes in regulatory and fiscal 
regimes, and the willingness of resource-rich countries to undertake new investment. 
In the Reference Scenario, oil production is projected to rise from 85 mb/d in 2006 to 
106 mb/d in 2030 and gas production from 3.0 tcm to 4.4 tcm, taking account of the 
economic viability of developing new reserves and various constraints on investment in 
each region. These projections imply a need for cumulative investment in the upstream 
oil and gas sector of around $8.4 trillion (in year-2007 dollars) over 2007-2030, or $350 
billion per year. Oil accounts for $5 trillion and gas for $3.3 trillion (Table 13.3).
Oil and gas investment falls in the second half of the projection period: the average 
annual  rate  of  upstream  oil  and  gas  investment  in  2007-2012,  derived  from  our 
bottom-up analysis, is estimated at over $500 billion (in year-2007 dollars). This rate is 
projected to dip to about $300 billion in 2016-2030, mainly because of the projected 
shift in output to lower-cost regions, notably the Middle East — by far the world’s 
lowest cost region. In short, the opportunities for international companies to invest 
in non-OPEC regions will diminish as the resource base contracts, eventually leaving 
the national companies to take on a larger responsibility for investment where the 
remaining  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  much  cheaper  to  develop.  Projected  upstream 
investment  is  nonetheless  considerably  higher  in  this  Outlook  than  in  last  year’s 
edition, reflecting the recent continued increase in unit costs and the assumption that 
they stabilise in 2008, rather than fall back as previously assumed (see above). 
4.  Effective spre OPEC production capacity is projected to rise 2.5 mb/d in 2008 to over 4 mb/d in 2009 and 
2010 — equal to around 5% of global demand, according to the July 2008 edition of the IEA Medium-Term 
Oil Market Report (IEA, 2008).
5.  This assessment assumes that project slippage, caused by shortages of labour, materials, rigs and other 
equipment, remains a major problem. Project delays are currently running at around one year, while delays 
at 20 major projects (excluding Kashagan and Thunder Horse, which have been subject to very long delays 
already) are estimated at around 15 months (IEA, 2008).

Around two-thirds of global cumulative upstream investment to 2030 is projected to 
be  made  in  non-OECD  countries  (Figure  13.16).  Investments  in  OECD  countries  are 
large, despite the small and declining share of these countries in world oil and gas 
production. In contrast, investment in Middle East countries represents only 13% of 
total investment, because of low unit costs in this region. The share of this region in 
world oil supply rises from 30% in 2007 to 37% in 2030, while its share of gas supply 
increases from 11% to 23%.

Potential barriers to upstream investment
Over the period to 2012, the total amount of investment that will be made in upstream 
oil and gas facilities is known with a reasonable degree of confidence. Investment plans 
may change in response to sudden changes in market conditions and some projects may 
be cancelled, delayed or accelerated for various reasons. But the actual gross additions 
to production capacity and the net additions (taking account of estimated decline rates 
at existing fields over that period) are unlikely to depart much from those projected 
in  this  Outlook.  However,  beyond  the  next  five  years  or  so,  there  is  considerable 
uncertainty about the prospects for upstream investment, costs and, therefore, the 
rate  of  capacity  additions.  Few  investment  decisions  that  will  determine  capacity 
additions  after  2012  have  yet  been  taken,  with  the  exception  of  some  very  large 
projects, such as the Kashagan development in Kazakhstan (where production is now 
expected to start up only in 2014 at the earliest, peaking later at around 0.8 mb/d).
In  our  judgment,  the  policies,  regulatory  frameworks  and  prices  assumed  in  the 
Reference  Scenario  could  together  create  an  investment  environment  conducive 
to stimulating the amount of investment projected above for 2007-2030 at the unit 
costs assumed. Nonetheless, the opportunities and incentives for private and publicly 
owned companies actually to undertake all of this investment are still very uncertain. 
In reality, investment in particular regions may fall short of that required to meet the 
projected level of supply — not least because prices and costs could turn out to be 
markedly different from those assumed. Host government policies, including licensing 
and fiscal arrangements, could shift and the overall investment and business climate 
may deteriorate, making upstream investments riskier and less attractive. Uncertainty 
about future climate-change and other environmental policies adds to investment risk 
(see Part C). Moreover, logistical, practical and technical factors may constrain the 
ability of oil and gas companies to launch upstream developments in a timely way. 
Not all of the uncertainties are on the down-side: in the longer term, technological 
advances, lower input prices and a more favourable policy environment could open 
up new opportunities for investment and help lower costs. Nonetheless, there is a 
regional dimension to this issue. Were investment in the lowest-cost regions — notably 
the Middle East — to fall short of that projected in the Reference Scenario, investment 
in other regions would need to be much higher, because of the higher costs, thus 
increasing overall upstream capital spending and requiring higher oil prices. The main 
potential barriers to upstream investment are reviewed below. 
Depletion policies of resource-rich countries
The  depletion  policies  of  the  small  number  of  countries  that  hold  the  bulk  of  the 
world’s  remaining  oil  and  gas  reserves  will  be  critical  to  investment  and  future 
capacity expansions — whether carried out by national or international companies. 
Paradoxically, the surge in oil prices in the past five years and the prospect of prices 
remaining  at  historically  high  levels  may  make  it  more  likely  that  some  of  those 
countries will decide to deplete their resources more slowly, simply because they have 
less need for additional revenue in the near term and may prefer to keep resources in 
the ground to benefit future generations. Were the oil-supply curve to bend backwards

326 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
in this way, a vicious circle might emerge of lower investment leading to tighter supply, 
which could in turn push up prices and revenues even more and further reduce the 
incentive to invest, eventually forcing the world to shift the pattern of consumption 
away from oil. 
Higher  prices  have  transformed  the  economic  well-being  of  those  hydrocarbon-
producing  states  for  which  oil  and  gas  export  earnings  represent  a  large  share  of 
national  income.  Most  such  hydrocarbon-dependent  states  are  members  of  OPEC. 
The total annual oil and gas export revenues (the value of total exports at prevailing 
international prices) of OPEC countries more than doubled between 2000 and 2007 in 
real terms, to a record $732 billion (Figure 13.17). In the Reference Scenario, OPEC 
revenues are projected to continue to grow, reaching a total of just over $2 trillion in 
2030. Oil remains by far the biggest contributor to OPEC revenues, but the share of gas 
grows. The share of total OPEC revenues in world GDP (at market exchange rates) rises 
from 1.3% in 2007 to around 2% in 2030. Six Middle East countries — Saudi Arabia, Iran, 
Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE — accounted for over 70% of these revenues in 2007, a 
share that is projected to remain broadly constant through to 2030. In these countries, 
much of the increase in revenues has been used to pay off external debt and acquire 
external assets, mostly financial. Russia’s oil and gas revenues also grow, from about 
$229 billion in 2007 to just over $400 billion in 2030.

Unlike  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s  in  the  aftermath  of  the  first  two  oil  shocks, 
government spending has increased much less quickly than the growth in revenues. 
This reflects, partly, caution about how long higher prices will persist, but also the 
limited capacity of these economies to absorb the additional revenues without stoking 
up inflation in the non-tradable goods sector. As a result, the government budgets in

all these countries have swung heavily into surplus. Most countries have long-term 
investment funds for short-term stabilisation purposes or to ensure income for future 
generations, and have rules that limit public spending to revenue generated under very 
conservative price assumptions. 
Concern that over-investment in the upstream sector may lead to lower prices is also 
likely to temper capital spending. The oil price required by OPEC countries to balance 
the external account has risen sharply in recent years, reflecting increased domestic 
spending (private and public) and rising import costs — partly the result of the fall in 
the dollar. According to a recent report, the price per barrel of oil equivalent to West 
Texas Intermediate ranges from $4 in Qatar to $94 in Venezuela (PFC, 2008). The price 
is projected to rise further in 2009, on the assumption of unchanged domestic policies 
(Figure 13.18).

There are signs that higher prices and revenues are blunting, rather than boosting, 
incentives  to  invest  more  in  upstream  developments  in  some  countries  —  even 
though  the  increase  in  revenues  is  generally  more  than  sufficient  to  cover  the 
capital  required  for  new  projects  and  the  potential  net  present  value  of  those 
projects  has  risen  sharply.  King  Abdullah  of  Saudi  Arabia  announced  in  April  2008 
that  he  wants  new  oil  discoveries  to  be  kept  in  the  ground  to  preserve  some  of 
the  Kingdom’s  oil  wealth  for  future  generations.  Other  Arabian  Gulf  countries, 
including  Qatar,  have  scaled  back  plans  to  boost  oil  and  gas  production  capacity, 
citing  the  need  to  preserve  resources  for  the  long  term.  Uncertainty  about  the 
future  call  on  OPEC  oil  supplies  in  the  face  of  much  higher  prices  and  the  risk  of 
investing  in  capacity  that  may  not  be  needed  (especially  if  consuming  countries 
were to take strong action to curb demand growth) are also, somewhat perversely,

encouraging producers to take a “wait and see” approach to major new investments. 
Thus,  there  is  a  real  and  growing  risk  that  upstream  investment  in  hydrocarbon-
rich  countries  will  falter  once  the  current  wave  of  projects  has  come  to  an  end.
Profitable opportunities for international companies to invest
Most  investment  in  dollar  terms  continues  to  be  carried  out  by  privately  owned 
international oil and gas companies. Yet the opportunities for them to invest in new 
developments have diminished in recent years, as a growing number of resource-rich 
countries  have  imposed  restrictions  on  foreign  participation  in  favour  of  national 
companies. This factor is discussed in detail in Chapter 14. Even where it is, in principle, 
possible for international companies to invest, the licensing and fiscal terms or the 
general business climate may be a deterrent. The objective of all host governments is 
to strike the right balance between maximising their share of the rent — the difference 
between  the  cost  of  production  and  the  selling  price  of  the  oil  produced  —  and 
maintaining investment at their chosen strategic level. But, in practice, short-term 
revenue needs may over-ride the longer-term considerations: exploiting investment 
already made, the government may raise taxes and royalty rates to increase revenues 
quickly, at the expense of new  investment. 
The average tax take — the share of all taxes and royalties in the wholesale price of oil 
and gas produced — has risen significantly in most countries in recent years, reflecting 
the surge in prices and rents. In some cases, the government take has risen to such an 
extent that new investment has been discouraged. Investment in gas drilling slumped 
in 2007 in Alberta in Canada, in response to proposals by the provincial government to 
raise royalty rates. Similarly, in Venezuela, a sharp increase in royalty rates in 2007 
and plans in 2008 to introduce a windfall tax on exports made by private operators 
appear to have dampened interest in investing in new upstream projects. The slump 
in drilling and decline in Russian oil production since the end of 2007 is largely due to 
earlier changes in the tax regime that effectively ensure that the government takes the 
bulk of the additional rent that accrues as prices rise, dampening incentives to invest. 
A more recent change reduced taxes in order to stimulate upstream investment and 
production. 
The stability of the upstream investment regime is a critical factor in oil companies’ 
evaluation of investment opportunities. Retrospective increases in taxes, applied to 
sunk investments, tend to lead investors to raise their hurdle rates of return when 
evaluating future investments to accommodate the higher perceived risk. Changes in 
environmental regulations can also prevent or deter investment. Growing concerns 
over the ecological impact of drilling in the Amazon jungle in Peru, for example, are 
likely to hamper efforts to boost investment and production. The discussion or actual 
introduction of taxes or penalties on carbon emissions from oil and gas production 
or on gas flaring also affects the attractiveness of new investments. Norway already 
has in place a tax on carbon emissions, while Nigeria recently announced that it will 
impose penalties on gas flaring from 2009. Australia is actively discussing taxing carbon 
emissions, which would affect gas investment.

Political constraints
Internal political and broader geopolitical factors may hold back upstream investment in 
many countries, in spite of favourable official policies and strong economic incentives. 
Several OPEC countries, notably Kuwait and Iran, have struggled to reach agreement 
on how best to attract the investment needed to meet official targets for production 
capacity,  with  the  result  that  expansion  projects  have  been  delayed  or  cancelled. 
Investment in Iran continues to be impeded by US and European sanctions and political 
pressure from other countries related to Iran’s nuclear activities. Political resistance to 
changes in the upstream regime in Mexico that would give private companies a bigger 
role in exploration and development have impeded efforts to expand investment in 
order to offset the decline in production from existing fields. 
War or civil conflict is a powerful deterrent in certain regions. No major oil company 
has yet decided to invest in Iraq, though the new government is negotiating exploration 
and development deals with several international companies. How soon large-scale 
investment in Iraq could begin and how quickly it could increase depend on political 
factors and a continuing improvement in security in the country, both of which remain 
highly uncertain. The possibility that heightened geopolitical tensions in other parts 
of the Middle East and in other regions may discourage or prevent inward investment 
in upstream developments and related LNG and export-pipeline projects can never be 
discounted. The long-term prospects for investment in Nigeria, for example, remain 
extremely uncertain in view of the worsening conflict in the Niger Delta, which holds 
the bulk of the country’s remaining oil and gas resources. 
Availability of people and equipment
Shortages of skilled labour and equipment have already contributed to the surge in 
upstream costs and project delays in recent years, and may continue to place a physical 
constraint on the rate at which the upstream industry is able to invest in and develop 
reserves. Labour shortages could be the biggest obstacle, given the long lead-times in 
recruiting and training suitable staff. The upstream labour force has contracted since 
the 1990s as a result of reduced recruitment and lay-offs, partly due to a cost-cutting 
drive, and — more recently — to a surge in retirements as the average age of oil-
company employees has risen. In the United States, the average oil-company employee 
is approaching 50 years old and more than half of all employees are due to retire within 
the next decade (NPC, 2007a). At the same time, staffing needs for new projects will 
rise. For example, the 160 offshore rigs currently being built will need to be staffed by 
about 30 000 people, though some will come from rigs that will be retired. 
Labour shortages are currently most acute among the most specialised workers, such 
as design engineers, who take longest to train. This has led to a widening of the gap 
between the demand and supply for mid-career technical staff (NPC, 2007b): in North 
America  and  Europe,  the  shortfall  is  expected  to  exceed  15%  of  demand  by  2012 
(Figure 13.19). Recent studies by Schlumberger Business Consulting predict a severe 
shortage  of  university  gradates  in  petroleum-related  disciplines  in  North  America, 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
330 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Russia  and  the  Middle  East,  though  surplus  graduates  in  other  regions  —  notably 
southeast  Asia  —  could,  in  principle,  bridge  the  gap  to  the  extent  that  linguistic, 
cultural and legal barriers can be overcome (Rostand, 2005 and 2006).
Not surprisingly, oil companies are responding to these labour shortages by offering 
incentives to staff to delay retirement, by re-hiring retired employees and by recruiting 
overseas staff. In Canada’s Athabasca oil-sands region, a large number of engineers 
and labourers have been recruited from countries as far away as China. The Canadian 
government has even offered citizenship to foreigners working on oil-sands projects 
as  an  incentive  to  attract  and  retain  skilled  workers.  Saudi  Aramco  has  launched 
an  initiative  to  create  domestic  engineering,  procurement  and  construction  (EPC) 
companies  to  operate  as  joint  ventures  with  existing  international  operators.  The 
aim is two-fold: to establish a ready source of EPC capability that can quickly respond 
to Aramco tenders for new projects at more predictable costs and to stimulate local 
employment and economic development.

Although demand for labour and equipment will undoubtedly increase in the coming 
decades, current high salaries and day-rates would be expected to stimulate increased 
capacity in the longer term, as more students opt for petroleum-rated disciplines and 
trades, and service companies invest in new equipment (including rigs). There are signs 
that the number of university students studying petroleum-related disciplines and the 
training of lower-skilled workers, such as pipe welders and  drilling labourers, is already 
on the rise. Many of the new graduates entering the field are in China and India. The 
latter country is conveniently located for migration to the Middle East, Russia and 
Central Asia, where much of the increase in oil and gas supplies is expected to occur. 
Several oil companies have stepped up their in-house training programmes and have 
strengthened  their  ties  with  universities.  The  construction  of  new  rigs  and  related 
drilling equipment has also picked up strongly in recent years (see above).

The question is whether that increase in capacity will be big enough to meet rising 
demand. The upstream industry is inherently cyclical, as each period of scarcity in 
oil-services capacity has been followed by a period of over-supply. It is likely that the 
industry will enter at least one period of over-capacity of labour and equipment, such 
as in the 1980s and 1990s, at some point over the projection period; but when that 
will occur and how long it will last are difficult to predict. Many in the industry believe 
that labour and equipment shortages will persist well into the next decade, even if 
the rate of cost inflation tempers in the near future. The credit crunch, which has 
reportedly led to the cancellation of some orders to build new rigs, may exacerbate 
such shortages.

CHAPTER 14
Chapter 14 - The structure of the upstream industry
THE STRUCTURE OF THE UPSTREAM 
INDUSTRY
Who will do what? 
A new world order is emerging in the upstream oil and gas industry. National oil   z
companies control most reserves, but account for a much smaller share of current 
production. This is set to change. In the Reference Scenario, their share of world 
oil production rises from about 57% in 2007 to 62% in 2030, accounting for about 
80% of total incremental oil production. 
In most of the countries with the largest oil and gas reserves, national companies   z
dominate the oil and gas industry; foreign companies are either not allowed to 
own and develop reserves, or are subject to restrictions. Higher oil prices and 
a growing conviction among political leaders that national companies serve the 
nation’s interests better than private and foreign oil companies have boosted 
the confidence and aspirations of national companies, some of them rivalling the 
international companies in technical capability and efficiency. 
The international oil companies, which have traditionally dominated the global   z
oil and gas industry, are increasingly being squeezed by the growing power of the 
national companies and by dwindling reserves and production in mature basins 
outside OPEC countries. The super-majors have been struggling to replace their 
proven reserves and expand production. The share of their cash earnings that is 
returned to shareholders has been growing. 
How the structure of the global oil and gas industry evolves in the coming decades   z
will have important implications for investment, production capacity and prices. 
The increasing dominance of national companies may make it less certain that 
the investment projected in this Outlook will actually be made. The long-term 
policies of the major resource-rich countries may favour slower depletion of their 
resources. And while some national companies, like Saudi Aramco, are strong in 
most areas, others may be less well placed to address financing, technical and 
managerial challenges in bringing new upstream capacity on stream. 
Stronger  partnerships  between  the  national  and  international  oil  companies   z
could  help  ensure  adequate  supplies  in  the  long  term.  The  mutual  benefits 
that could accrue are compelling: the national companies control most of the 
world’s  remaining  reserves,  but  in  some  cases  lack  the  technology,  capital 
and/or skilled personnel to develop them efficiently; the international companies 
are opportunity-constrained, but have the finance and management skills, and 
technology to help national companies develop their reserves.
H I G H L I G H T S
© OECD/IEA, 2008
The governments of producing and consuming countries have a role to play in   z
encouraging  this  development:  producer  governments  through  institutional, 
regulatory and fiscal reforms aimed at attracting foreign participation and at 
getting the national companies to operate more commercially; and consumer 
governments through high-level dialogue and multi-lateral trade and development 
agencies.
The emergence of a new world order for oil
The last decade has seen a rapid transformation in the structure of the upstream oil 
and gas industry, involving in particular a wave of mergers and acquisitions among the 
international and private domestic oil companies, and a renaissance in the market 
power of state-owned national oil companies. Higher oil and gas prices and efficiency 
gains  throughout  their  supply  chains  have  bolstered  the  profits  and  free  cash-flow 
of the international oil companies. Yet they face increasing difficulties in obtaining 
access to profitable new investment opportunities and maintaining production levels. 
The national oil companies in the leading resource-holding countries are increasingly 
taking on the task of developing new fields themselves, often with the help of oilfield-
services companies. They are, in many cases, seeking to expand internationally. The 
increasing ambitions of the national companies reflect a trend in emerging economies 
towards greater direct state control over natural resources, a phenomenon commonly 
referred to as “resource nationalism”. There are few signs of any reversal of this trend 
on the horizon. 
The evolution of the structure of the global upstream industry matters, because the 
corporate objectives, technical competences, operational capabilities and financial 
resources  of  the  various  players  differ  markedly  —  both  among  and  between  the 
national and international companies. This has implications for the scale and types 
of investment that will be made and the way producing assets are managed. There 
are concerns that the national companies may, in general, be less willing than the 
international companies to develop and produce remaining oil and gas reserves on the 
scale required to meet global demand (see Chapter 13). They may also be less well 
placed financially and technically to develop reserves in an efficient manner. These 
concerns have already contributed to tensions on international oil markets and will 
grow as upstream developments become more technically challenging and expensive. 
They could have implications for the long-term security of the world’s oil and gas 
supplies. 
On  the  other  hand,  national  companies  are  becoming  more  technically  proficient 
and  better  able  to  handle  challenging  new  developments  with  the  help  of  the 
oilfield-services  companies.  New  forms  of  partnership  between  the  national  and 
international  companies  could  evolve.  The  evolution  of  the  interplay  between  the 
national oil companies in resource-rich countries, the oilfield-services companies and 
the international companies will, therefore, be central to investment and production 
prospects going forward.

Chapter 14 - The structure of the upstream industry 335
National oil companies currently account for 51% of world oil and gas production, the 
super-majors for 12%; other integrated international oil companies and wholly upstream 
companies account for the rest (Figure 14.1). The national companies’ share of world 
proven reserves is much higher, at 71%. For oil alone, the super-majors own only 3% 
of reserves, yet produce 12% of the world’s supply. This imbalance suggests that the 
share of the national companies in world oil and gas production could grow markedly 
over the longer term, though much will depend on the policy of host governments on 
the appropriate rate of depletion of national assets and the benefits of working with 
international companies through partnerships, production-sharing agreements or other 
types  of  co-operative  arrangements.  The  national  companies’  share  of  production 
has risen in recent years, partly because of production-sharing deals that reduce the 
allocation to foreign partners as the oil price rises.

In most of the countries with the largest oil reserves, national companies dominate 
the  oil  and  gas  industry;  foreign  companies  are  either  not  allowed  to  own  and 
develop reserves, or are subject to restrictions under prevailing laws and regulations 
(Figure  14.2).  Such  restrictions  have  been  put  in  place  both  for  constitutional  and 
operational  reasons:  some  host  governments  are  obliged  by  law  and  local  political 
expectation  to  retain  direct  control  over  their  natural  resources  and  some  prefer 
to exercise short-term management control over the reservoirs in order to maintain 
flexibility in their depletion policies. Among the 20 leading countries for oil reserves, 
only four — Brazil, Canada, Norway and the United States — give foreign companies 
unrestricted access to reserves. In four countries — Iran, Kuwait, Mexico and Saudi

Arabia — no foreign company is allowed to explore for or develop oil other than as a sub-
contractor or supplier of technical oilfield services to the national companies or other 
local firms. 1  Iraq effectively remains closed to foreign investment until parliamentary 
approval is secured to a proposed oil law that would open up the upstream and security 
is improved, though the Iraqi government is currently negotiating service contracts 
with foreign companies, which would be remunerated in cash or oil. Several countries 
permit  foreign  investment  only  in  the  form  of  production-sharing  deals,  whereby 
ownership of and control over reserves remains with the national company.

The resurgence of the national oil companies
The last decade has seen a dramatic revival of the financial health and market power 
of national oil companies, 2  helped by a combination of rising oil prices and a growing 
conviction  among  some  political  leaders  that  such  companies  serve  the  nation’s 
interests better than private and foreign oil companies. The national oil companies, 
1.   In these countries, no foreign contractor is allowed to “book” oil reserves, i.e. declare ownership of any 
reserves they ﬁ nd or help to produce under stock market regulations listed in the United States, Canada 
or Europe. Up to now, Kuwait has permitted international companies to provide technical services to the 
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), but only under short-term contracts. KPC is reportedly negotiating 
with those companies longer-term contracts that would, for the ﬁ rst time, link technical and commercial 
arrangements to performance — an approach favoured by the international companies. 
2.   The term refers here to any oil and/or gas company involved in upstream activities that is wholly or 
majority owned by the state.

Chapter 14 - The structure of the upstream industry
the largest of which are based in the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela, increasingly 
dominate world oil and gas supply: of the top 25 producing companies, 17 are national 
companies (Table 14.1). Most of them continue to focus on domestic operations — 
often along the entire supply chain and often including both oil and gas — though some 
companies are increasingly investing outside their national borders. In some countries, 
there  is  more  than  one  national  company,  one  or  more  of  which  may  be  partially 
privately owned, for example in Russia and China. 3  In each of the 13 OPEC countries, 
there is a single, wholly state-owned company with exclusive or special rights over 
most upstream activities and, in some cases, downstream operations, too. 4  With the 
exception of Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, all OPEC national companies participate 
in  joint  ventures  with  foreign  companies  to  develop  domestic  resources.  Norway, 
Mexico and Turkey are the only OECD countries that still have national companies with 
upstream operations of any size: StatoilHydro is 62.5% owned by the Norwegian state, 
while Mexico’s Pemex and Turkey’s TPAO are both wholly state-owned. All the major 
producing countries outside the OECD have national companies.
In several resource-rich countries, tentative moves to open the upstream sector to 
direct  investment  by  international  oil  companies  have  either  been  reversed,  as  in 
Venezuela, or have stalled, as in Kuwait. Saudi Arabia dropped a scheme to open up 
the gas sector to large-scale exploration and development in 2003, following difficult 
negotiations with the super-majors, but subsequently negotiated smaller deals with 
several international companies. In other countries, the market position of national 
companies has expanded. In Russia, the bulk of reserves and producing assets are once 
again in the hands of state-owned firms — principally Gazprom (the world’s largest gas 
company) and Rosneft (an integrated oil company) — as the government has sought to 
reassert strategic control over the sector. Most Russian oil and gas companies had been 
privatised in the 1990s. Foreign company upstream assets have been partially or wholly 
transferred to the national company in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador.
National  companies  are  extremely  diverse.  The  most  advanced,  such  as  Norway’s 
StatoilHydro,  Brazil’s  Petrobras  and  Malaysia’s  Petronas,  are  comparable  in  size, 
efficiency,  technological  sophistication  and  management  practices  to  the  larger 
international  companies.  Saudi  Aramco,  which  has  invested  heavily  in  training  and 
research, is widely recognised as the most technically advanced of the Middle East 
national  companies.  Others,  particularly  in  some  Middle  East  countries,  lack  high-
quality  human  resources  and  advanced  technical  capabilities,  and  focus  mainly  on 
operating existing facilities rather than actively developing new reserves.
A common characteristic of all national oil companies is that their corporate objectives 
go beyond the maximisation of the return on capital to shareholders (i.e. the state 
and, in some cases, private investors, too). They are typically required to contribute to 
broader national goals, including promoting industrialisation and economic and social 
development, ensuring energy security and supporting foreign policy (Marcel, 2006). 
3.  The three national companies in China are all fully state-owned but have listed subsidiaries, which are 
partially privately owned.
4.   Iran unveiled plans in early 2008 to partially privatise its national company, National Iranian Oil Company, 
through the sale of a minority stake in a new holding company with assets worth a total of $90 billion. 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
The majority of national companies are required to supply oil products and/or gas 
to the domestic market at subsidised prices. This is the case for all of the national 
oil companies in OPEC countries and for many others in large consuming countries, 
including China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico. In many cases, some or all of the 
resulting financial losses incurred by the national company are covered by payments 
out of the state budget. Most national companies are expected to provide jobs for 
local workers, to give preference to local suppliers in procuring goods and services, 
and to encourage the transfer of technical knowledge and expertise to local firms. 
These wider, often non-commercial objectives may diminish the national companies’ 
technical and economic efficiency by comparison with private firms (see below). Most 
national companies have close ties with their government owners, with geopolitical 
and strategic goals explicitly or implicitly superimposed on their purely commercial 
objectives.

340 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The  growing  maturity  of  some  national  companies  is  reflected  in  their  expanding 
technical  capabilities  and  international  expansion.  Some  have  invested  heavily  in 
developing in-house expertise, with the aim of reducing their reliance on partnerships 
with  international  companies,  extracting  more  of  the  value  added  from  oil-sector 
activities  and  contributing  to  broader  economic  and  social  development.  National 
companies  have  generally  suffered  less  than  the  international  companies  from 
manpower shortages, as they were largely sheltered from the boom-bust cycle of the 
1980s and 1990s in the international upstream sector. The national companies’ growing 
experience  and  capabilities  have  enabled  them  to  contract  directly  with  oilfield-
services companies, in some cases by-passing the international companies completely. 
The growing importance of services companies as developers and owners of technology, 
which  can  be  licensed  to  operators,  has  helped  to  facilitate  this  development 
(Box  14.1).  Some  national  companies,  notably  Petrobras  and  StatoilHydro,  have 
emerged as world leaders in deepwater drilling.
The national companies, especially in net oil-importing (consuming) countries such 
as  China  and  India,  are  also  expanding  internationally,  mainly  in  competition  with 
international  companies.  National  companies  accounted  for  a  record  one-third  of 
global upstream mergers and acquisition (M&A) spending in 2006, the bulk of which 
was cross-border (Herold and Harrison Lovegrove, 2007). They were the buyers in the 
largest transaction in every region outside North America, accounting for four of the ten 
largest transactions worldwide. National companies’ share of global M&A fell slightly 
to around 29% in 2007, though the value of deals outside their base countries remained 
level at around $13 billion (Herold and Harrison Lovegrove, 2008). Several national 
companies  now  have  significant  upstream  producing  assets  overseas  (Figure  14.3). 
Others,  including  Saudi  Aramco,  have  invested  in  downstream  operations.  Recent 
exploration bidding rounds in non-OECD countries, including Algeria, Libya and Egypt, 
have  attracted  increasing  numbers  of  national  companies.  National  companies  are 
generally more willing to accept involvement in non-oil related infrastructure projects, 
such as roads, schools and hospitals, in order to gain access to upstream assets.
For producing countries, internationalisation is motivated by strategic and economic 
considerations. These include securing access to markets, capturing additional value 
from their oil and gas production, reducing their exposure to volatile crude oil prices, 
gaining access to skills and technology, and expanding the business in the long term 
(Fryklund, 2008). Although security of supply is often cited as the principal objective 
of overseas investment by national companies in consuming countries, a desire to seek 
out  profitable  business  opportunities  and  to  leverage  the  company’s  technical  and 
financial resources is also often a major driver. This would appear to be the case with 
the Chinese national companies, CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC, which have been recently 
among the most active national companies in building up portfolios of overseas assets 
(IEA, 2007).

Box 14.1  z   The rise of the oilfield-services companies
Oilfield-services companies provide a range of services related to oil and gas 
exploration and production, but do not typically produce petroleum themselves. 
These  services  include  seismic  data  acquisition,  processing  and  analysis,  well 
drilling, completion, evaluation and stimulation, and production-related services 
(well  monitoring,  production  maintenance,  flow  assurance  and  enhanced 
recovery  technologies).  In  addition,  oil  companies  increasingly  sub-contract 
their information technology and systems integration. The customers of oilfield-
services  companies  include  national,  international  and  private  domestic  oil 
companies. The services companies have grown rapidly in recent years with the 
surge in upstream investment and the growing reliance of national companies for 
the technical expertise to help them develop their reserves. In some cases, they 
are used in preference to their own domestic service companies. In a variant of 
the customary relationship, Chinese oil companies often make use of domestic 
contractors who use technologies and equipment purchased from international 
service companies.
In areas where national oil companies are looking for arrangements other than 
exploration concessions, production sharing or joint ventures, oilfield-services 
companies offer an alternative form of partnership and, in so doing, compete 
with the international companies. In addition to providing a growing range of 
advanced technologies and services, oilfield-services companies are now able to 
offer integrated project-management services and even turnkey operations.
The revenue growth rates of the top three service companies — Schlumberger, 
Halliburton and Baker Hughes — over the period 2005-2007 averaged 25% per 
annum, mainly through organic growth (but with the scale of the figure explained 
largely  by  the  big  cost  increases  described  in  Chapter  13).  Oilfield-services 
companies  have  increasingly  focused  on  their  core  upstream  business,  at  the 
expense of more peripheral activities. Some of them are moving away from their 
North American bases and establishing an increasingly international presence, 
thereby reducing their dependency on US natural gas cycles and riding the wave 
of  the  expansion  of  international  activity.  They  have  also  generally  left  the  
drilling activity to major drilling contractors; the offshore market has seen the  
merger of some of the largest drilling companies, as a result of the high level of 
investment required for the latest generation of offshore drilling units.
Some  of  the  largest  service  companies  nonetheless  offer  a  nearly  complete 
portfolio of services, including the provision of  integrated services, whereby 
they co-ordinate the activities of several contractors, ranging from well drilling 
and completion to field development, but without holding equity in the field. 
Investment in personnel recruiting, training and development has been stepped 
up. The three largest companies have hired over 15 000 technical staff per year 
over the last three years, while their R&D expenditures have increased by 15% 
to 20% per year and now exceed those of most of the international and national 
oil companies.

342 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Internationalisation  strategies  and  priorities  vary  markedly  among  the  national 
companies.  Strategies  include  stand-alone  investments,  strategic  partnerships  and 
joint  ventures,  equity  stakes  in  listed  companies,  asset  swaps  and  government-to-
government  deals.  Some  governments  provide  diplomatic  support  to  their  national 
companies to gain access to acreage and assets, with mixed success. Nonetheless, 
most  national  companies  have  a  long-term  ambition  to  expand  internationally, 
vertically  along  the  supply  chain  and,  in  some  cases,  horizontally  across  oil,  gas 
and  related  sectors.  Consequently,  national  companies  increasingly  compete  with 
each  other  in  the  hunt  for  assets.  But  partnerships  between  national  companies 
are  also  becoming  more  common.  Asian  companies  have  been  particularly  active 
in  partnering  with  other  national  companies  in  recent  years.  All  three  Chinese 
national  companies  have  joint-venture  investments  with  other  national  companies, 
mainly  in  Africa.  In  April  2008,  India’s  ONGC  agreed  to  form  a  joint  venture  with 
Venezuela’s PDVSA to develop the latter’s extra-heavy oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt.

The recent surge in oil prices has unquestionably contributed to the growing confidence 
and  expanding  reach  of  the  national  companies  in  producing  countries.  Higher 
revenues have reduced or eliminated financial constraints on their funding of capital-
spending  programmes  or  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Their  upstream  investment  has 
risen sharply (see Chapter 13). In addition, many national companies, both producers 
and consumers, have improved their corporate governance, establishing management 
structures that are more arms-length from government. Several — including the three 
Chinese national companies and Gazprom — have become partially privately owned, 
with their shares listed on major stock exchanges. As a result, they become subject to 
the same financial and accounting controls as international companies. Stock-market 
listings have also allowed them to raise capital from private sources to supplement 
direct government funding.

International oil companies in profitable retreat 
The international oil companies, which have traditionally dominated the global oil and 
gas industry, are increasingly being squeezed by the growing power of the national 
companies and by dwindling reserves and production in mature basins outside OPEC 
countries.  Their  recent  record  profits  and  robust  balance  sheets  mask  increasing 
difficulties in acquiring new upstream assets and expanding production in the long 
term. Indeed, the five “super-majors” — ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Total and Chevron 
— have seen a drop in their collective oil production in the last three years, while 
that of other private companies (mainly smaller international companies) has been 
flat (Figure 14.4). Part of the decline in the super-majors’ output is an automatic 
consequence of the provision in production-sharing agreements that cuts their share 
of production as prices rise. Production by the national companies has grown strongly 
since 2003. Nonetheless, the international companies still rank among the largest oil 
and gas producers worldwide. The super-majors alone accounted for 12% of world oil 
production in 2007.

Higher oil and gas prices have underpinned a sharp rise in the gross revenues of the 
international oil companies and in their profits — despite higher operating costs and 
host-government taxes and royalties. The net income (after tax) of the five super-
majors totalled $131 billion in 2007 — a four-fold increase over 2002 (in nominal terms). 
For  most  companies,  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in  income  has  come  from  upstream 
activities, which have traditionally generated much higher investment returns than 
refining, marketing and chemicals (even though margins in those sectors have also 
improved in recent years). For the super-majors, net income rose broadly in line with 
crude oil prices between 2002 and 2005, but has since grown less rapidly in response to 
higher government takes and rising costs (Figure 14.5).

How the international companies have disposed of their revenues reveals much about 
their corporate strategies. The combined operating cash-flow 5  — a better indicator 
of  the  availability  of  discretionary  financial  resources  than  net  income  —  of  20  of 
the  largest  companies  almost  tripled  from  $118  billion  in  2000  to  $323  billion  in 
2006, before falling back slightly to $284 billion in 2007 (Figure 14.6).  Half of the 
increase over the seven years to 2007 was returned to shareholders in the form of 
equity buybacks (or share repurchases) and dividends. Over that period, almost 36% of 
operating cash-flow was used in these ways. Buybacks have become more important 
than dividends, accounting for about one-fifth of total outlays in 2007, compared with 
less than one-tenth in 2000. The current rate of share buybacks cannot be sustained 
indefinitely. For example, if ExxonMobil was to maintain its current rate of buybacks, 
it would cease to be a public company in around 15 years.  
Capital spending by the international companies on both exploring for and developing 
oil and gas reserves has risen significantly, though most of this increase is explained 
by rising unit costs rather than increased physical activity (see Chapter 13). As a share 
of  operating  cash-flow,  total  spending  on  exploration  and  development  by  the  20 
companies surveyed here jumped from 37% in 2000 to a high of 57% in 2003, but has 
since fluctuated between 40% and 50%. The share devoted to reserve acquisitions from 
other firms has also fallen in recent years, reflecting both a renewed strategic focus on 
organic growth and increasing competition from national companies. These trends are 
explained largely by the spending patterns of the five super-majors, which account for 
59% of the total available cash of the 20 largest companies surveyed.
Despite increased spending on exploration, the super-majors have been struggling to 
replace their proven reserves. Since 2000, their oil and gas reserves-replacement ratio 
(reserves addition related to production) has averaged 107%, but plunged to 54% in 2007
5.   Operating cash-ﬂ ow is a net ﬁ gure: the amount of cash a company generates from operating activities, 
less the cost of sales.

(Figure 14.7). Smaller international companies have been much more successful. Some 
21 other leading companies (including pure exploration and production companies) 
replaced almost 200% of their production on average between 2000 and 2007. The 
differences are explained, at least in part, by relatively higher spending by the smaller 
companies on both acquisitions and exploration. 
A  lack  of  opportunities  to  invest  upstream  is  one  of  the  principal  reasons  for  the 
apparent  under-investment  in  exploration  since  the  1990s  and  the  resulting  low 
reserves  replacement  rates  by  international  oil  companies,  as  most  reserves  are 
controlled by national companies. Because of their financial strength and technical 
and project management skills, the super-majors have a competitive advantage over 
smaller private and national companies in pursuing complex and “lumpy” projects; but 
such projects are becoming fewer and farther between outside the OPEC countries 
and, in any case, carry higher risks. Smaller firms are often better placed to take on 
the development of smaller new fields and old fields well into decline, both of which 
account for a growing proportion of capital spending in mature basins, such as the North 
Sea and onshore North America. Large amounts of prospective North American acreage 
remain off limits to exploration for environmental reasons. Allied to these problems is 
a general shortage in recent years of skilled personnel and drilling equipment, which 
have pushed up rig-rates and the cost of oilfield-services and, in some cases, prompted 
companies to postpone project approval or to slow completion. 
Notwithstanding  the  limited  availability  of  upstream  investment  opportunities  and 
bottlenecks  in  skilled  labour  and  equipment,  the  relatively  low  ratio  of  upstream 
investment  to  operating  cash-flow  among  the  international  companies  appears  to 
reflect a deliberate policy of maximising short-term accounting profits. In essence, 
the management and shareholders (represented by large institutional investors) have

based on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting rules. The vagaries of those rules 
can result in large year-on-year adjustments to reserves. For example, Shell’s ratio was only 17% in 2007, 
reflecting the effects of deconsolidation of reserves at the Sakhalin-2 project, in which its stake was reduced 
from 55% to 27.5%. The associated reserves, however, were reduced by much more, as it was previously 
permitted to book all of them.  The sharp fall in 2004 for the super-majors partly reflects a downward 
restatement of reserves by Shell.

judged that it is better to maximise short-run returns by limiting capital spending, 
so as to return a larger share of cash-flow to shareholders. In recent years, financial 
markets have focused increasingly on the rate of return to average capital employed 
(RoACE) – a financial indicator used by markets to benchmark and value oil companies. 
RoACE automatically falls in the short-term as investment rises, as a smaller proportion 
of total capital employed is depreciated. Thus, companies with a larger proportion of 
mature, or legacy, assets tend to achieve a higher RoACE. Since the end of the 1990s, 
investors appear to have given greater weight to RoACE than to other, more long-
term measures of corporate value and performance, such as reserves and production 
capacity (Osmundsen et al., 2005; Jaffe and Soligo, 2007). In addition, RoACE is usually 
one of several indicators used to remunerate senior managers. RoACE rose for all of the 
five super-majors from 2002 to 2005, but has been flat or has fallen for some of them 
since then (Figure 14.8).
The  increased  focus  on  maximising  short-run  profits  is  reflected  in  the  highly 
conservative price assumptions and high hurdle rates of return oil companies use to 
determine whether or not to invest in specific projects. Most oil companies continue 
to assume a crude oil price well below actual market levels. For example, BP raised 
the assumed price of Brent crude oil which it uses to calculate the net present value of 
projects under evaluation from $40 to $60 per barrel for five years ahead in February 
2008, when the market price was close to $100. In a survey of almost 250 oil companies 
made by Citigroup in December 2007, the gap between the planning price and the price

implied by the futures market had  increased to a record level of more than $20 a 
barrel. 6   Volatile  oil  prices  and  the  long  lead-times  associated  with  major  upstream 
projects increase the risk that prices may fall below assumed planning levels by the time 
the project comes on stream, though futures and derivatives markets increasingly allow 
companies to hedge part of their exposure to new investments by taking short positions 
to match future production flows.
How the strategic direction of the international companies may change in the medium 
to long term is uncertain. As the super-majors and other international companies face 
intense competitive pressure from national and oilfield-services companies, as well as 
from specialist upstream companies, refiners and marketers, some analysts have even 
questioned whether the fundamental business model of international companies is still 
viable. In recent years, their response to the changing business environment has been to 
focus on their core business activities — oil and gas production, refining and processing, 
chemicals production, transportation, distribution and marketing — and they have, for 
the most part, resisted the temptation to diversify on a large scale into other energy-
supply businesses (with the exception, in some cases, of power generation). There has 
been a shift towards natural gas and, specifically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) — an area 
in which the super-majors and some other international companies can play to their 
technological, financial and management strengths (IEA, 2008). All the super-majors 
plan to increase their spending on LNG as a share of their total capital spending. 
Questions are being raised about whether the international companies should or will 
retain the traditional vertically integrated business model. One option is to divest or 
spin off into joint ventures much of their downstream portfolios, including refining, 
chemicals  and  retailing.  Another  is  to  pursue  horizontal  integration  by  investing 
in  alternative  energy  technologies,  including  renewables  and  nuclear  power.  For 
6.  Reported in The Financial Times, 5 February 2008. The latest Lehman Brothers global exploration and 
production spending survey, published in December 2007, found that the average price at which companies 
would reduce their investment was $50.65 per barrel of WTI crude oil and $5.23 per thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas (Lehman Brothers, 2007).

example, Total, which already holds a stake in Areva, the world’s leading provider 
of nuclear power services, announced in 2007 its intention to expand its investments 
in the nuclear sector and has since joined forces with GDF Suez to develop a nuclear 
power plant in the United Arab Emirates. BP continues to build up its alternative energy 
business, having invested $1.5 billion in the three years to 2007 and with a further 
$1.5 billion planned for 2008. But even with expenditure on this scale, alternative 
energy represents for these companies only a small part of the overall business. Other 
companies, including ExxonMobil, have been reluctant so far to commit capital on a 
large scale to non-hydrocarbons-related activities, on the grounds that they lie outside 
their area of competence and the profitability of such ventures is uncertain. History 
indeed  suggests  that  large  firms  in  maturing  industries  struggle  to  adapt  to  new, 
substitute technologies, as evidenced by the oil companies’ unsuccessful foray into 
renewables and synthetic fuels in the 1970s and 1980s.
Whatever the chosen path, if the international companies are to survive in the long 
term as major players in the upstream sector, in the face of threats to their market 
share from the national companies and the oilfield-services companies, they will need 
to maintain their competitive advantage in managing large-scale, complex upstream 
projects, notably in frontier regions and in gas. Research and development of cutting-
edge technology will remain critical to achieving this goal. All the super-majors and 
most  of  the  other  large  international  companies  have  recently  sharply  increased 
their research budgets to meet the increasing technical challenges they will face in 
developing new reserves and to remain competitive with oilfield-services companies. 
For example, Shell spent $1.2 billion on research in 2007 — almost double what it had 
spent the year before, while the 2008 research budgets have been increased by BP by 
15% to $1.3 billion, and by Total by 20% to $1 billion. But services companies are also 
increasing their research budgets, on the back of strong cash-flow and higher profits. 
Schlumberger increased its spending by close to one-fifth in 2007 and by a similar 
amount in 2008, to a level of almost $900 million. A growing proportion of this spending 
is devoted to deepwater and gas-related technologies, notably LNG. Shell is building 
the first-ever floating liquefaction platform, which is set to be deployed in northwest 
Australia. Carbon capture and management is expected to account for a growing share 
of research budgets in the future.
Implications for future investment and supply
How the structure of the global oil and gas industry evolves in the coming decades 
will  have  important  implications  for  investment,  production  capacity  and  prices. 
The national oil companies’ share of global oil and gas production is expected to rise in 
the medium to long term, by virtue of their control over most of the world’s remaining 
oil resources. In the Reference Scenario, their share of oil production rises from 57% in 
2007 to 62% in 2030 — not allowing for the fluctuations in ownership under production-
sharing agreements as the crude oil price changes (Figure 14.9). 7  Their share of natural 
7.   In practice, the ownership of some reserves will inevitably change between the host-country national 
companies and private companies under production-sharing deals as crude oil prices ﬂ uctuate.

gas output also rises, from 44% to 55%. These projections assume sufficient investment 
is made in exploration, development and production to meet demand at the assumed 
price. This assumption is already in question as a result of the risk that major resource-
rich countries may favour slower depletion of their hydrocarbon resources. A further 
question arises as to the ability and readiness of the national companies, financially 
and technically, to bring new upstream capacity on stream on a sufficient scale in a 
timely and efficient way, particularly in the light of their lower efficiency, taken as a 
group, and their wider remit. For example, the large subsidies to domestic oil product 
and gas sales that characterise most national companies undercut their profitability 
and cash-flow and, therefore, limit funds for capital spending, as does the cost of 
the social and economic programmes that they are often tasked with running. One 
recent study (Eller et al., 2007) found wholly state-owned firms that sell oil products 
at subsidised prices to be only 35% as technically efficient as large privately owned 
international companies which are under no obligation to subsidise. One result of these 
factors is that national companies are generally less well placed than the international 
companies to raise capital on favourable terms on international financial markets.

Though  this  indicator  needs  to  be  hedged  with  many  qualifications,  revenue  per 
employee  provides  one  indication  of  both  the  technical  efficiency  of  a  company’s 
operations and the degree to which its sales are made at prices below full market 
value. Output in volume terms per employee provides another indication of technical 
efficiency, but again with many qualifications relating to geological conditions and 
the degree of vertical integration (the larger a company’s downstream business, the 
lower the upstream production per employee). There is a clear correlation between 
the two indicators, as higher productivity unsurprisingly contributes to higher revenue

per  employee.  Both  indicators  are  generally  higher  for  the  super-majors  than  for 
the  national  oil  companies  (Figure  14.10).  Saudi  Aramco  has  the  highest  volume 
productivity of any of the companies surveyed here, reflecting not only good business 
practice, but the relatively large share of upstream output in its overall business and 
its low reserve-development costs, thanks to favourable geology. ExxonMobil — the 
most profitable of all the international companies in absolute terms — has the highest 
revenue per employee.

Towards a more efficient industry
Some government owners are already introducing reforms to improve the performance 
of the national oil companies. Important elements include the following:  
Reduction  of  subsidies  on  domestic  sales  through  price  reform,  to  increase   
oil  company  revenues,  to  eliminate  waste  and  to  bolster  their  self-financing 
capacity. 
Promotion  of  competition  in  the  domestic  upstream  and/or  downstream   
sectors.
Stricter accounting and financial standards, reporting and monitoring.  
Establishment of an arms-length management structure, including an autonomous   
board of directors, to protect management from ad hoc political interference.
Improved access to international credit markets, through public share offerings   
and commercial bonds.

Chapter 14 - The structure of the upstream industry 351
14
Focus  on  core  activities  and  the  transfer  of  social  and  peripheral  industrial   
activities to separate bodies. 
Progress  has  been  patchy  so  far.  In  most  countries  with  national  oil  companies, 
subsidies remain large and competition limited. In Iran and Saudi Arabia alone, oil 
product  subsidies,  mostly  carried  by  national  oil  company  distributors,  reached  a 
staggering $53 billion in 2007 — up by $6 billion on the previous year — and they are 
thought to have risen further in 2008. But a growing number of countries, especially 
in Asia, are reducing, or are planning to reduce, retail subsidies on oil products in 
response to soaring costs (see Chapter 3). Russia is planning gradually to phase out 
subsidies on domestic sales of gas, which amounted to an estimated $30 billion in 2007 
(see Chapter 1). 
Though financial accounting and reporting remain opaque in some countries, notably in 
Africa (see Chapter 15), important improvements have been made in some countries and 
the majority of national companies have become more commercially driven and have  
established more transparent and formal decision-making processes and frameworks. 
For example, Algeria liberalised its upstream industry in 2005, involving the removal of 
the obligation on foreign companies to partner with the national company, Sonatrach, 
and the transfer of regulatory functions from Sonatrach to new government agencies. 
The three Chinese national companies have divested many of their non-core activities 
and, between 2000 and 2002, opened their equity to foreign investors through initial 
public  offerings,  in  order  to  raise  capital  for  international  expansion.  The  growing 
reliance  of  national  companies  on  international  capital  markets  and  the  sale  of 
minority equity stakes have led to improved compliance with international accounting 
standards, greater transparency and better corporate governance.
Strengthening strategic partnerships
Partnerships between the national and international companies provide one important 
means  of  securing  the  financial,  technical  and  management  resources  required 
to  develop  national  company  reserves.  The  mutual  benefits  that  could  accrue  are 
compelling: the national companies control most of the world’s remaining reserves, but 
some lack the technology and skilled personnel to do much more than simply maintain 
existing producing assets; the international companies are opportunity-constrained, 
but have the management skills and technology to help national companies develop 
their reserves. 
The super-majors, with their project-management experience and technical expertise, 
are particularly well placed to help national companies develop liquefied natural gas 
projects and complex gas fields, as well as deploy enhanced oil recovery techniques. 
For example, Chevron won a production-sharing contract with PetroChina in 2007 to 
develop the onshore Chuandongbei gas field in the Sichuan Basin, which is high in 
sulphur and carbon dioxide, is relatively wet and suffers from low rock permeability. In 
2007, under a similar agreement, Shell started producing gas from the remote Changbei 
field, which has tight gas reservoirs requiring advanced technology to boost recovery 
rates. Although national companies can buy many new technologies off the shelf and 
hire oilfield-services companies to deploy them, the international companies still lead

352 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
the way in applying cutting-edge technologies and in managing large and technically 
complex projects. The super-majors and other international companies also have the 
financial strength to underwrite mega-projects — a major attraction where budgetary 
and borrowing restrictions limit the financial capacity of national oil companies. The 
National Iranian Oil Company and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, for example, are 
required to hand over the bulk of their revenues to their government owners, putting 
at risk their ability to meet their long-term official capacity targets.
The  strategic  match  between  what  the  international  companies  have  to  offer  and 
the national companies need is likely to become closer in the long term. Worldwide, 
new  developments  are  set  to  become  more  technically  challenging,  as  the  easiest 
reserves are depleted and drilling shifts to deepwater and less accessible locations 
and  reservoirs.  The  associated  financial  challenge  could  be  heightened  by  a  drop 
in oil prices, which would put project finance at risk, especially in those countries 
accustomed to diverting a large share of the companies’ cash-flow to the national 
treasury to finance social spending or energy-consumption subsidies.
Such strategic partnerships are already being formed. They have operated successfully 
in  several  countries,  including  Abu  Dhabi,  Oman  and  Qatar.  Yet  such  successes 
have been limited. There have been difficulties in finding common ground, amidst 
frustrations  on  both  sides  about  the  results  of  previous  joint  ventures.  Rising 
confidence of the part of the national companies in their ability to “go it alone” has 
met reluctance on the part of international companies to accept a role as contractors. 
They have preferred to hold out for production-sharing and concession agreements 
that allow them to book reserves and which promise higher returns. This stand-off has 
opened the way for service companies to establish themselves in countries that refuse 
to give foreign companies access on these terms. 
For international-national company partnerships to develop successfully, innovative 
approaches will need to be adopted that better align the needs and expectations of 
both sides. The international companies seem likely to have to accept a role closer to 
that of the service providers, but perhaps offering a more comprehensive package of 
services than the service companies are currently able to provide. They will need to 
maintain their technical edge: technical hitches and delays that have plagued a number 
of recent mega-projects have tarnished the reputation of the international companies 
in these areas. 
International  companies  could  also,  on  suitable  terms,  assist  the  host-country  in 
meeting its social and economic development goals. This would involve maximising the 
use of local staff and contractors promoting the transfer of skills to the local workforce 
— an attractive proposition to the national companies. An expanded pool of skilled 
labour would help relieve the acute shortages that have contributed to upstream cost 
inflation worldwide in recent years, benefiting both the national and international 
companies (see Chapter 13). The obstacles should not be under-estimated. Transferring 
skills  and  technology  in  practice  can  be  very  difficult,  however,  because  of  weak 
management  and  an  ill-adapted  corporate  culture  within  the  national  company 
(Marcel, 2006). Contractual arrangements have to be appropriate.

National  companies,  for  their  part,  will  need  to  offer  contract  terms  that  provide 
adequate financial incentives for the international companies. The Saudi government 
failed to attract the participation of the super-majors in large-scale integrated gas 
exploration  and  development  projects  in  the  early  2000s  because  the  companies 
considered  the  returns  on  offer  inadequate  in  view  of  the  risks  and  opportunities 
involved. Mexico has had little success in persuading international companies to sign 
service agreements as the fixed returns on offer are judged too small and the reserves 
cannot, by law, be booked by the international companies. Iran has also had limited 
success in attracting upstream investment by the super-majors under buyback deals, 
under which the National Iranian Oil Company retains ownership of the reserves. The 
ability to book reserves is an increasingly important consideration for the international 
companies, as financial markets focus increasingly on reserve-replacement ratios. 
International strategic alliances can be one way of consolidating new relationships. In 
the absence of satisfactory partnership arrangements, national companies are likely to 
acquire foreign-owned assets outright as they expand in size, ambition and financial 
and technical strength. Such a development could raise concerns about the impact on 
supply security, but inter-regional integration can also be seen as a means of building 
mutual dependence. 
Traditionally,  upstream  joint  ventures  and  partnerships  between  national  and 
international companies have involved the latter providing technical input to projects 
in  the  former’s  home  country.  But  such  partnerships  are  likely  increasingly  to 
involve investments in third-party countries, as national companies seek to expand 
internationally. Total recently sold a 20% stake to each of Qatar Petroleum and Algeria’s 
Sonatrach in the Taoudenni Ta7 and Ta8 permits in a project in Mauritania. This type 
of deal is seen as a means of building a foundation for future collaboration. Upstream-
downstream asset swaps are one way forward, providing the national companies with 
an opportunity to integrate their businesses more fully downstream while leaving the 
international companies to exploit their core strengths.
Governments  of  both  producing  and  consuming  countries  have  a  role  to  play.  The 
government owners of the national companies can encourage foreign participation by 
pursuing institutional, regulatory and fiscal reforms. The consuming countries need to 
show that they recognise the sovereign right of resource-rich countries to manage their 
resources in the way they judge best serves their national interest, offering support 
through high-level dialogue and multi-lateral trade and development agencies.

355 Chapter 15 - Prospects in oil- and gas-exporting sub-Saharan African countries
PROSPECTS IN OIL- AND GAS-EXPORTING 
SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES
Could their resources alleviate energy 
poverty?
Conventional oil production in the ten largest hydrocarbon-producing countries in   z
sub-Saharan Africa reached 5.6 mb/d in 2007, of which 5.1 mb/d was exported. In the 
Reference Scenario, output grows to 6.9 mb/d in 2015 and then rises more gradually 
to 7.4 mb/d in 2030. Oil exports climb to 6.4 mb/d in 2030. Gas production in these 
countries increases from 36 bcm in 2006 to 163 bcm in 2030. Most of the increase is 
exported. These projections hinge on a reduction in gas flaring, adequate investment 
and avoidance of disruption to supplies through civil unrest.
  z The  cumulative  government  take  from  oil  and  gas  revenues  in  the  ten  countries 
analysed  here  is  projected,  in  aggregate,  at  $4.1  trillion  over  2006-2030.  Nigeria 
and  Angola  remain  the  largest  exporters,  with  combined  cumulative  revenues  of 
about $3.5 trillion. Oil accounts for the bulk of these revenues. Taxes on oil and gas 
production account for more than 50% of total government revenues in most of the 
oil- and gas-rich sub-Saharan African countries.
  z Despite the vast hydrocarbon wealth of these countries, most of their citizens remain 
poor. As a result, household access to modern energy services is very limited. Two-
thirds  of  households  do  not  have  access  to  electricity  and  three-quarters  do  not 
have access to clean fuels for cooking, relying instead on fuelwood and charcoal. 
Unless there are major government initiatives to address this problem, the number 
of electricity-deprived people is projected to increase over the projection period. 
More than half of the total population of these countries still relies on fuelwood and 
charcoal for cooking in 2030. 
  z Tackling  energy  poverty  is  well  within  these  countries’  means.  We  estimate  the 
capital cost of providing minimal energy services (electricity and liquefied petroleum 
gas stoves and cylinders) to these households over the Outlook period to be about 
$18 billion. This is roughly equivalent to only 0.4% of the governments’ take from oil 
and gas exports over the Outlook period.
  z An improvement in the efficiency of revenue allocation and the accountability of 
governments in the use of public funds would improve the likelihood of oil and gas 
revenues  actually  being  used  to  alleviate  poverty  generally  and  energy  poverty 
specifically. Energy is key to sustainable development, bringing major benefits to 
public health, social welfare and economic productivity. Since affordability is the 
main barrier to access, efforts to tackle energy poverty need to go hand in hand with 
broader policies aimed at raising incomes and promoting economic development.

Overview 1
This  chapter  provides  an  outlook  for  oil  and  gas  production,  government  take  and 
household energy access in the ten largest hydrocarbon-producing sub-Saharan African 
countries (Table 15.1). 2  These countries account for 99% of the region’s proven 3  oil 
reserves and 97% of its gas reserves. They also produce 99% of the region’s oil and 93% 
of its gas. Worldwide, these countries contribute 7% to global output of oil and 12% 
of oil trade. Gas exports from these countries represent about 5% of global gas trade. 
Exports of both oil and gas (in the form of liquefied natural gas, LNG) are set to grow 
rapidly.

The economies of these countries are heavily reliant on the oil and gas sector (OECD, 
2008).  Oil  and  gas  contributed  87%  to  GDP  in  Equatorial  Guinea  in  2006,  while  oil 
contributed 57% to Angolan GDP in the same year. Oil accounted for over 70% of GDP in 
Congo in 2006. Taxes on oil and gas production constitute a very large portion of total 
government tax revenues in these sub-Saharan African countries. Except in Cameroon, 
Côte d’Ivoire and Mozambique, oil and gas sector revenues account for more than half

of total government revenues (Figure 15.1). In Congo, the figure is over 80%. The share 
of the value of oil and gas exports in total exports is also very high. Oil exports alone 
constitute over 90% of total exports in Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Sudan.

Despite the wealth these resources represent, household energy access in the countries 
assessed  here  is  very  limited.  Less  than  a  third  of  households  in  Angola,  Cameroon,
Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sudan and Mozambique have access to electricity 
(Table 15.2). Electricity access in rural areas is even lower in all countries: it is estimated 
to be only 16% in Côte d’Ivoire and 26% in Nigeria. Other modern forms of energy are also 
scarce. Fewer than 25% of households in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Congo and 
Sudan have access to clean fuels for cooking, like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, 
biogas and ethanol gelfuel. The majority of households cook with fuelwood and charcoal 
over open fires or in inefficient stoves. Over 95% of rural households in Angola, Cameroon, 
Chad, Congo and Sudan rely on fuelwood and charcoal for cooking, a share comparable to 
that applying in Benin, Ghana and Zambia.
Oil-  and  gas-rich  countries  could  use  the  proceeds  from  taxes  and  royalties  on 
production to pay for wider energy access and to meet other basic needs of their 
poorest households. Sharply higher revenues from the high oil and gas prices which 
have prevailed recently are making this more affordable. In addition, these countries 
could make direct use of their gas resources, for example, by using currently flared 
gas for power generation or distributing it in cities. The LPG extracted from natural 
gas or produced in refineries can provide a low-cost source of supply for distribution 
networks. Yet the use of oil and gas resources for domestic consumption is rarely a 
government priority in these countries, while companies usually have little interest in 
getting involved in small-scale energy-distribution projects in immature local markets 
because of the cost.

In brief, energy poverty is stark in the ten countries analysed here, as stark as in other 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of new policy initiatives, the number 
of people living without electricity and exposed to the health risks associated with 
the burning of fuelwood and charcoal for cooking will actually rise over the Outlook 
period, as the population grows. Tackling this problem will require comprehensive and 
co-ordinated economic and social development plans and policies, with a much greater 
focus on effective management of the wealth generated by hydrocarbon resources. 
A first requirement is to make oil and gas revenues transparent to the public. They will 
ultimately hold governments accountable for the allocation of these revenues.

Resources and reserves
Proven  oil  reserves  in  the  ten  sub-Saharan  African  countries  assessed  here  are 
estimated at 57 billion barrels, some 4% of world reserves. At a current production 
level of 5.6 million barrels per day (mb/d), these reserves would sustain production for

another 28 years. Significant offshore undiscovered oil resources lie in water between 
2 000 metres and 4 000 metres deep in some areas, especially offshore Angola (USGS, 
2000). Proven gas reserves amount to 6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) or about 3% of world 
reserves. Undiscovered resources are particularly abundant in the Niger and Congo 
deltas. 
Nigeria has the largest proven hydrocarbon reserves of any African country, which stood 
at 68 billion barrels oil equivalent at end-2007. They amount to 73% of all the oil and 
gas reserves of the ten sub-Saharan African countries assessed here (Figure 15.2). The 
Nigerian government plans to expand its proven oil reserves, which currently amount 
to 36 billion barrels, to 40 billion barrels by 2010. Most of the reserves are found along 
the country’s Niger River Delta, in southern Nigeria and offshore in the Bight of Benin, 
Gulf of Guinea and Bight of Bonny. Virtually all of the large discoveries in recent years 
on the west coast of Africa have been made in deepwater offshore fields.

Oil and gas production and exports
There is considerable difference in production maturity among the oil-rich sub-Saharan 
African  countries.  In  Table  15.3,  we  classify  the  countries  into  three  categories, 
according to the percentage of initial 2P reserves already produced: new producers; 
steady  and  rising  producers;  and  declining  producers.  The  largest  oil  producers  — 
Nigeria,  Angola  and  Sudan  —  are  expected  to  increase  their  production  capacity 
significantly, while Chad is only now beginning its production cycle. 
Aggregate oil production in these sub-Saharan Africa countries was 5.6 mb/d in 2007. 
Conventional  oil  production  is  projected  to  increase  to  6.9  mb/d  in  2015  and  to 
7.4 mb/d in 2030 (Figure 15.3). Production in Nigeria and Angola combined represents 
84% of total production in 2030, compared with about three-quarters today. All of 
the sanctioned and planned projects in these two countries — 15 projects in Angola

in fields holding some 5.4 billion barrels and 11 projects in Nigeria with 5.1 billion 
barrels — are offshore. All of the identified reserves with no firm projects planned 
are offshore in Angola, while over 65% of the identified reserves in Nigeria are in 
onshore fields.

Sub-Saharan African countries exported 5.1 mb/d of oil in 2007, or about 91% of total 
production. Most of these exports were crude oil. Despite rising local demand for oil, 
driven in large part by the economic boost provided by rising oil-related earnings, 
exports are projected to rise to 6.4 mb/d in 2030. Oil exports from Angola, Sudan and 
Nigeria are expected to continue to grow steadily over the Outlook period. Cameroon 
becomes a net oil importer after 2020.

361 Chapter 15 - Prospects in oil- and gas-exporting sub-Saharan African countries
Gas production and exports, largely as LNG, are also expected to grow strongly. In the 
Reference Scenario, the marketable gas production of the complete group of countries 
increases from 36 bcm in 2006 to 82 bcm in 2015 and 163 bcm in 2030. The largest gas 
producers in 2030 are Nigeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Mozambique. Most of the 
increase in gas output is exported. Exports rise from 21.6 bcm in 2006 to 63 bcm in 2015 
and 130 bcm in 2030. Nigeria’s gas exports are expected to reach 101 bcm by 2030, 
while Angola’s reach 7 bcm in 2012. A reduction in gas flaring is expected to make a 
major contribution to marketable gas supply (Box 15.1). Primary oil and gas demand 
in these countries is projected to grow on average by 3.5% per year over the Outlook 
period.
Box 15.1 z  Gas flaring: what are the costs?
Worldwide, 150 bcm of associated gas was flared in 2005, emitting 400 million 
tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere  (World  Bank,  2007).  The  sub-
Saharan African countries assessed here flared 40 bcm — a level unchanged since 
2000  (Figure  15.4).  This  is  almost  three  times  the  region’s  gas  consumption. 
Nigeria is among the world’s biggest flarers, with some 25 bcm flared in 2005, 
nearly half of its total gas production. 4  Nigeria’s ratio of gas flared to oil produced 
is 18 times higher than that in the North Sea. So much gas is flared because 
there is no infrastructure to bring the gas to market, a consequence of the poor 
potential returns and high risks associated with building such infrastructure. 
Gas flaring wastes a valuable resource. Capturing and using the gas could bring 
large economic, social and environmental benefits. In the case of Nigeria, the 
monetary value of the gas lost in 2005, at a price of $5 per MBtu, was about 
$5 billion. Nigeria is committed to reducing flaring. It signed the Kyoto Protocol 
in December 2004 and its gas-flaring reduction projects qualify under the Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM), under which the flared gas has a potential value 
of  $800  million,  based  on  current  Certified  Emission  Reduction  prices,  as  an 
addition to its market value. Options for reducing flaring include gas reinjection 
in oil and gas fields, distribution to local markets by pipeline, and gas processing 
into LNG, LPG or GTL. But several gas-export projects have been delayed and 
Nigeria’s domestic market has been very slow to develop due to domestic gas-
pricing policies, which set prices too low to make investments in distribution 
networks profitable, and poor payment discipline on the part of industrial and 
power consumers. Consequently, the initial target set by Nigeria to stop flaring 
in 2008 will not be met. 
In  practice,  reducing  gas  flaring  will  require  the  imposition  and  enforcement 
of strict environmental standards, penalties on flaring and financial incentives 
to  accelerate  the  development  of  domestic  infrastructure  and  markets  for 
associated gas. Emerging-country producers need fully to consider the long-term 
economic value of associated gas when negotiating and executing contracts with 
operators.
4.  Flaring is believed to have been reduced to 22 bcm in 2006 (IEA, 2008).

A significant portion of Nigeria’s natural gas is already processed into LNG. Nigeria 
completed the first phase of the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) facility on Bonny Island 
in 1999. In 2006, NLNG completed its fifth train, increasing annual production capacity 
to  24  bcm  per  year.  A  sixth  train  was  completed  in  late  2007,  raising  production 
capacity to 31 bcm per year, but this has not yet been brought into operation, for lack 
of feedstock. Three other projects are under development — Brass LNG, Olokola LNG 
and a seventh train at NLNG — but a final investment decision has not been taken on 
any of them, making it unlikely that any will be commissioned before 2012. In Angola, 
Chevron and Sonangol, together with other shareholders including Total, BP and Eni, 
are planning to build a 7-bcm LNG plant, which is expected to be operational in 2012. 
The  West  Africa  Gas  Pipeline  project  was  commissioned  in  December  2007,  with 
commercial operation expected to begin in 2008. Initial capacity is 2.1 bcm per year 
and it is expected to ramp up to a full capacity of 4.6 bcm per year within 15 years. 
The 678-km pipeline carries natural gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Togo and Benin. It 
is intended to supply gas to power stations in all three countries in order to reduce 
dependence on diesel. Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea are in discussion about a pipeline 
connecting the two countries to feed a second train at Equatorial Guinea’s LNG plant 
on Bioko Island. 
Nigeria  and  Algeria  are  studying  the  possibility  of  constructing  a  trans-Saharan  gas 
pipeline. The 4 023-km pipeline would carry 20 bcm to 30 bcm per year of associated 
natural  gas  from  oilfields  in  Nigeria’s  Delta  region  to  Algeria’s  Beni  Saf  LNG  export 
terminal on the Mediterranean. It is estimated that construction of the $7-billion line 
would take six years. Current and planned oil and gas infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa 
is shown in Figure 15.5.
Civil  unrest  has  bedevilled  some  of  these  countries  at  various  times  in  past  years, 
substantially increasing the risk associated with exploiting their reserves and holding 
back  investment.  Civil  conflicts  at  the  Niger  Delta  have  resulted  in  serious  supply 
disruptions, as attacks on oil facilities have forced companies to halt or slow production

and  delay  loadings.  Around  550  kb/d  of  Nigeria’s  oil-production  capacity  has  been 
unavailable since 2006 as a result. The cost of deepwater exploration could rise further 
in the wake of general cost inflation (See Chapter 13).

Oil refining
There are 11 refineries in the assessed countries and another 10 in the rest of sub-
Saharan  Africa.  Total  crude  distillation  capacity  at  the  11  refineries  is  just  over 
800 kb/d. Nigeria has four refineries, but all of them operate well below their official 
capacity, leaving some 77% of product demand to be met by imports in 2007. In the past, 
the government has opted to export crude oil and collect taxes on imported refined 
products rather than invest in improving refining capacity. The Nigerian government 
has not been able to attract any significant private investment in the refining sector. 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
364 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The Angolan government is keen to attract investment in a second, greenfield refinery 
in Lobito. Refineries in Africa face difficulties in competing with producers from the 
Middle East and Asia. They often do not enjoy the benefit of economies of scale, and 
their product slate can be unsuited to local demand. India is emerging as a key exporter 
of refined products to Africa. 
The lack of refining capacity is an important political issue in Africa. Most oil-producing 
countries would like to extract more of the value of their crude oil by refining it locally, 
rather than exporting it and importing products. Increased local availability should also 
help to lower the cost of supplying local markets.
Oil and gas export revenues 
Based on projected exports and our assumptions for oil prices (see Chapter 1), the 
government take 5  from oil and gas exports from the assessed countries is estimated to 
rise from some $80 billion in 2006 to about $250 billion in 2030. Revenues in Nigeria and 
Angola dwarf those in all the other countries. Nigeria’s revenues in 2030 reach nearly 
$150 billion and Angola’s some $80 billion. These two countries account for 86% of the 
$4.1 trillion cumulative revenues of all ten countries over 2006-2030 (Figure 15.6).
Per-capita oil and gas revenues vary widely among the assessed countries. Revenue per 
capita over the Outlook period averages some $515 in Nigeria but is close to $2 000 in 
Angola. In Gabon, average annual revenue per capita is some $2 700. It is over $5 000 
in Equatorial Guinea.

Household energy access in sub-Saharan African 
countries
Sub-Saharan Africa desperately needs sustained and sustainable economic development, 
and clean cooking fuels and access to electricity are two prerequisites. Yet, the share 
of  households  without  electricity  access  across  all  countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa 
5.  We have assumed the average government take equates to 67%.

is 73% on average, compared with 27% in non-OECD Asia and 10% in Latin America 
(IEA, 2006b). Moreover, there appears to be virtually no correlation between oil and 
gas resource endowments and access to modern energy in sub-Saharan Africa. In the 
countries with limited or no oil and gas reserves, the percentage of the population 
without access to electricity ranges from 6% in Mauritius to 94% in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (IEA, 2006b). 6   Six of the ten sub-Saharan African countries assessed 
here have the same or a higher share of people without electricity access than the 
average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Likewise, the share of the population relying 
on fuelwood and charcoal for cooking is similar in these hydrocarbon-rich countries to 
that in the sub-Saharan African countries not analysed here, where it ranges from about 
95% in Ethiopia to some 20% in South Africa. 
Cooking practices 
The current use of fuelwood and charcoal for cooking in sub-Saharan Africa has serious 
implications for the environment, for economic development and for health. Charcoal 
is widely used for cooking and is usually produced from forest resources. Because of 
the low conversion efficiency of the kilns used to produce charcoal, there has been 
localised  deforestation  and  land  degradation  around  urban  centres.  In  Angola,  the 
major influx of people to peri-urban areas, or shanty towns, at the end of the civil 
war has put tremendous pressure on biomass resources. Severe local deforestation has 
occurred around most large cities. For example, all forest has been cleared within a 
radius of 200 to 300 kilometres of Luanda, Angola (IEA, 2006a).
In  households  that  rely  on  fuelwood,  women  and  children  are  responsible  for  fuel 
collection, a time-consuming and exhausting task. Collection time has a significant 
opportunity cost, limiting time to improve education and engage in income-generating 
activities.  Modern  energy  services  for  cooking  promote  economic  development  by 
freeing-up household time for more productive purposes. 
Lack of access to clean fuels for cooking can have a serious impact on health. Exposure 
to indoor air pollution from burning fuelwood, charcoal and other biomass in poorly 
ventilated  areas  has  been  linked  to  many  different  diseases,  including  acute  and 
chronic respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, asthma, cardiovascular disease and negative 
peri-natal health outcomes. Indoor air pollution disproportionately affects women and 
children, who spend the most time near the cookstove. An estimated 79 000 people die 
prematurely in Nigeria alone each year because of the use of fuelwood and charcoal for 
cooking (Table 15.4). The percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to 
the use of fuelwood and charcoal for cooking is nearly 7% in Angola and more than 5% 
in Cameroon and Chad (WHO, 2007). In every country in Table 15.4, more people die 
prematurely each year from illnesses caused by indoor air pollution than from malaria.
Due  to  affordability  and  access  barriers  to  the  uptake  of  LPG  and  other  cleaner-
burning fuels for cooking, many households will continue to use fuelwood and charcoal 
for  cooking.  Improving  the  way  these  resources  are  used  is  an  important  way  of 
reducing their harmful effects. The first requirements are improved stoves and better

ventilation: adding chimneys to stoves is the most effective improvement to be made 
from the point of view of health, while kitchen design and ventilation also play a key 
role  in  reducing  emissions.  Particulate  levels  in  houses  using  wood,  but  with  good 
ventilation, can be lower than those in houses using liquid fuels in poorly designed 
stoves. Governments can enhance the sustainability of biomass resources by increasing 
the area of the country dedicated to plantations, and through monitoring and control 
of charcoal production.

Electricity access
Access  to  reliable  electricity  is  important  for  many  services,  such  as  lighting  and 
communications,  but  crucial  for  refrigeration,  which  avoids  food  waste  and  allows 
local clinics to keep medicines on hand. Clinics lacking electricity cannot perform such 
routine functions as sterilising instruments or safely storing vaccines. 
Yet, as we have seen (Table 15.2), in eight out of the ten sub-Saharan African countries 
assessed here, less than a third of the population has access to electricity. Even where 
access to electricity is available, it does not necessarily mean that electricity is available 
on  demand.  Even  those  Africans  who  do  have  access  frequently  have  to  cope  with 
unreliable supply. Power disruptions are a fundamental obstacle to economic activity, 
including  at  the  household  level.  In  war-torn  countries,  such  as  Angola,  Congo,  Côte 
d’Ivoire, Chad and Sudan, the infrastructure for electricity transmission and distribution 
has often been destroyed. Service restoration is more costly than the average cost of

serving new customers in a stable environment. Inadequacies in the supply infrastructure 
are one reason why many people make illegal connections, sometimes resulting in injuries, 
electrocution, fire, explosions and death — often involving children. 7  In addition to the 
health risks, illegal connections also mean loss of revenue to the electricity distribution 
companies and, consequently, greater difficulty in financing infrastructure improvements. 
In order to take advantage of economies of scale as a step towards easing regional power 
shortages, regional power pools are being developed (Box 15.2).
Box 15.2 z  Regional power pools and the Grand Inga project
Regional power pools have been formed in Central (CAPP), East (EAPP), Southern 
(SAPP), and West (WAPP) Africa (Figure 15.7). The pools are at very different 
stages of development, both technically and institutionally. The political process 
is well advanced in the WAPP, supported by political agreements at the head of 
state level through the Economic Community of West African States. The SAPP 
was the first operational power pool in Africa, sponsored under the authority of 
the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The pools, particularly the 
WAPP and SAPP, have facilitated significant cross-border exchanges of power.
Regional power pools are able to reduce costs and improve conditions on the supply 
side. Operational costs are lower, due to investment in least-cost power generation 
plants on a regional basis. Benefits on the supply side, all contributing to increased 
reliability,  include  reduced  coincident  peak  loads  on  the  regional  power  pool, 
compared with the sum of the individual peak loads for each national power grid, 
shared power generation reserves for the interconnected power grids, and increased 
robustness to deal with local droughts or other unexpected events.
One of the key projects that will support the regional pools is the Grand Inga dam 
project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project is estimated to 
cost $80 billion and expected to be able to provide 40 GW of power. Difficulties 
associated with the project include an absence of political consensus and legal 
harmonisation. Nigeria is expected to be the largest consumer. It is hoped that 
the carbon-emission reduction potential will help attract necessary investment. 
Most of the power will be used for industry or for export. Inga 1 and Inga 2 were 
commissioned in 1972 and 1982, as part of an industrial development scheme in the 
DRC. The two dams currently operate at only 40% capacity because they have never 
received maintenance. The World Bank is partially financing a project to rehabilitate 
these dams. 8  When Inga 2 was built, a 1 800-km transmission line was also built to 
transport the power to state-owned copper mines in the Katanga province, bypassing 
nearly every city and village underneath. A component of the Grand Inga project 
could  be  expanded  household  electricity  access,  particularly  in  the  DRC,  where 
access is estimated to be 13% in urban areas and only 3% in rural areas.
7.  To date, there have been no comprehensive studies on the number of deaths and injuries from illegal 
connections. There is a need to better quantify the number in order to raise awareness of the consequences 
arising from the inability to obtain legal electricity connections.

368 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
Nigeria is experiencing a severe electricity shortage. Three new gas-fuelled power stations 
are unable to generate electricity because the country has over-sold gas for export and 
because  the  domestic  electricity-supply  infrastructure  is  inadequate.  Nigeria’s  power 
generation  capacity  plunged  to  less  than  1  000  MW  in  July  2008. 9   As  a  step  towards 
improving the situation, in February 2008 Nigeria announced a new gas policy, which will 
prioritise the domestic use of gas over export. Under the policy, all gas developers are 
expected to allocate a specified amount of gas from their reserves and annual production 
to the domestic market. Gas for domestic use will be supplied at the lowest commercially 
sustainable prices to strategic sectors, such as electricity. The Nigerian government plans 
to build 15 new gas-fired power plants to increase generating capacity to 10 GW by 2010.

Box 15.3 z  Government programmes to promote the use of clean cooking 
fuels and rural electrification in Africa: success stories
Strong government support is essential to expand energy access, because low 
incomes prevent a large number of people from accessing even basic services. 
Gas and electricity are now widely available in Cape Verde and electrification 
rates are much higher than a decade ago in Botswana, in both cases due to well-
chosen government reforms and effective implementation. 
The governments of Kenya and Tunisia have also addressed the lack of energy 
access  through  innovative  policy  frameworks  and  financing  mechanisms.  In 
Kenya,  the  household  energy  mix  is  dominated  by  the  use  of  fuelwood  and 
charcoal for cooking. To reduce high dependence on these fuels, the government 
introduced a number of measures to improve access to and the affordability of 
LPG.  Households’  access  to  credit  was  improved,  largely  through  the  Kenyan 
Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCCO), an umbrella organisation for 
nearly 4 900 agricultural co-operatives in Kenya. Rapid growth of LPG followed 
the decision to remove the VAT and import duty on LPG, and to set standards for 
LPG stoves, cylinders and accessories. Lack of standardised LPG cylinders, with 
inter-changeable valves and regulators, had previously been a major obstacle to 
the development of efficient and competitive LPG retail markets in Kenya. The 
acceleration in the penetration of LPG in Kenya demonstrates the facilitating role 
governments can play, providing a policy and regulatory framework attractive to 
prospective energy and financial investors, and to users (Kabutha et al., 2007).
The  Tunisian  government  expanded  electricity  access  from  37%  in  the  early 
1970s to an impressive 99% in 2006 (IEA, 2006b). The government laid out its 
targets in five-year plans aimed at overall rural development. Renewable-energy 
projects were selected at the regional level as part of rural development plans, 
which  covered  health,  education,  water  and  other  infrastructure.  Success 
was  attributed  to  efficient  central  direction,  decentralised  implementation, 
transparent norms and guidelines, and innovative technical decisions, such as 
the use of single-wire earth systems. 10  Private sector participation in construction 
and  the  participation  of  the  local  supply  industry  were  also  important.  But 
national political commitment is widely regarded as the key factor in the success 
of the programme. 
Projected trends in access to modern energy services
In the Reference Scenario, which assumes the continuation of existing policies, the 
number of people without access to electricity in the ten sub-Saharan African countries 
assessed here rises from some 177 million today to 191 million in 2030 (Table 15.5), as 
the population grows. This is despite the fact that 56% of the people in these countries 
have access to electricity in 2030, up from 35% today. The number of people relying on

remote areas.

fuelwood and charcoal for cooking similarly rises, from 204 million to 244 million, again 
despite a rise in the share of the population with access to clean fuels for cooking, from 
25% to 43%. The disparity between rural and urban areas remains pronounced. The 
majority of the people who gain access to both electricity and cleaner fuels for cooking 
over the projection period live in urban areas.

Economic growth is the main factor driving the improvements in energy access. In 
part because of higher oil prices, economic growth in the countries assessed here is 
expected to be faster than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Urbanisation rates are 
also an important factor driving energy demand, as households in cities are more 
likely to be connected to the grid and to have access to cleaner cooking fuels. Nigeria 
is making progress in reducing the number of people who lack access to electricity, 
a  trend  that  is  projected  to  continue  through  the  Outlook  period.  But  the  very 
large number of people who lack access to clean cooking fuels is projected to rise 
considerably. Mozambique and Angola are expected to make progress in expanding 
the supply of cleaner cooking fuels. 
Quantifying the costs involved in expanding access
Expanding access to electricity and modern cooking stoves will require substantial 
additional investment in power generation and networks and appliances beyond 
that projected in our Reference Scenario. In order to illustrate the challenge, we 
have estimated the cost over the Outlook period to achieve universal access to

15
modern energy services (electricity and LPG 11 ) by 2030 in the ten countries assessed 
here. The figure comes to some $18 billion, almost half of this arising in Nigeria 
(Figure 15.8). 
We assume that a constant percentage of people gain access to electricity each year. 
A minimum consumption rate of 73 kWh per person per year is assumed. 12  The costs 
have been calculated separately for central grid, mini-grid and off-grid technologies. 
Central  grid  power  is  the  least  expensive  option  but  will  not  be  available  to
most rural households. Off-grid diesel generators have the lowest investment cost
per  kW,  followed  by  mini-grid  hydro-based  electrification.  However,  generators 
entail  an  additional  annual  expense  for  diesel  of  about  $24  per  person.  Solar 
photovoltaics technology is very expensive, and its role is assumed to be limited 
(Box 15.4).

The average cost of providing electricity in urban areas is $370 per household. The 
cost of electrifying peri-urban areas, where most of the people without access live, 
is  higher.  Peri-urban  areas  are  challenging  to  serve  because  they  are  poorly  built 
and are not laid out uniformly. In rural areas, the average cost is estimated to be 
$425  per  household.  To  provide  electricity  by  2030  to  the  191  million  people  who 
would otherwise have no access will require investment of some $15 billion, covering 
generation, transmission and distribution.

The costs of switching to LPG for households that rely predominately on fuelwood 
and  charcoal  for  cooking  include  capital  expenditure  for  the  stove  and  cylinder, 
and recurring expenditure for the fuel itself. In this analysis, we look only at the 
capital expenditure for the LPG stove and cylinder, which is assumed to be $65 per 
household. This upfront capital cost is a very significant barrier to change. The total 
cost of providing stoves and cylinders to all households otherwise relying on fuelwood 
and charcoal for cooking is some $2.9 billion.
Box 15.4 z  The prospects for renewables to meet rural household energy 
needs
Renewable energy supply — mostly hydropower — is expected to grow rapidly 
in the coming decades in Africa. Yet, introduction of these technologies will 
require strong government support. Hydropower potential in sub-Saharan Africa 
is  estimated  to  amount  to  more  than  1  800  TWh  of  technically  exploitable 
resources  (Karekezi  and  Kithyoma,  2008).  Small  hydropower  is  an  important 
source  of  energy  in  rural  areas.  The  Hidraluapasso  mini-hydro  project  in 
northern  Angola,  for  example,  will  provide  26  MW  at  a  cost  of  $120  million 
(UNEP, 2008).
Solar energy is perhaps the most widespread renewable energy resource. A very 
large number of African countries have daily solar radiation ranging between 4 
and 6 kWh per square metre. Nonetheless, the cost of an off-grid installation can 
be prohibitive, ranging from $550 to $1 200 per household (Moner-Girona et al., 
2006). Wind energy is gaining popularity, but many sub-Saharan African countries 
have low wind speeds, particularly those near the equator. Chad, however, has 
good wind potential in some parts of the country. 
The  use  of  renewable  energy  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  could  help  mitigate  the 
impact of high oil prices, especially if renewable energy systems replace diesel 
generators. But the institutional frameworks and infrastructure needed vigorously 
to expand renewable energy systems has been lacking. Government policies and 
programmes to promote renewable energy are needed.
Of course, owning stoves and cylinders does not ensure that people will use them if 
they cannot afford the fuel. Fuel costs are very expensive for African households, 
many of whom live on less than $1 per day. 13  LPG prices have soared over the past few 
years and, assuming an average cost of LPG of $1.50 per kilogram — based on 2008 
consumer prices in a sample of African countries — the total fuel bill for a household 
of five would be over $200 per year. Bulk transport costs are higher in landlocked 
countries and poor transport can increase the cost of fuel delivery. In Chad, LPG 
13.  The World Bank estimates that, on average, some 47% of households in sub-Saharan Africa live on less 
than $1 per day.

costs about $2.30 per kilogram. Price subsidies on LPG have had a poor record of
success in many countries, because they often fail to benefit the poorest households 
(Box 15.5). 14
Box 15.5 z  Subsidies: how best to safeguard energy-poor households?
As  in  all  developing  countries,  there  is  pressure  on  African  governments  to 
shield their consumers, through universal subsidies, from sharply rising oil and 
gas prices. But the downside of such energy subsidies is widely acknowledged: 
unintended inequitable distribution, inefficiencies, over-consumption, smuggling 
and a drain on government resources that could be more efficiently used. The 
result is, often, increased social inequality and, usually, economic inefficiency. 
Wealthy  households  are  much  more  likely  to  benefit  from  subsidies  than  the 
poorest ones. 
Financial  assistance  is  most  effective  when  it  is  successfully  targeted  at  the 
poorest  households  and  offered  as  income  support  rather  than  universal  fuel 
subsidies.  After  eliminating  LPG  price  subsidies  in  2002,  Brazil  introduced  a 
gas  assistance  programme  that  provides  bi-monthly  subsidy  payments  for  the 
poorest households. The new approach provides an annual per-capita subsidy 
to qualifying households that amounts to more than 60% of the retail LPG price 
— more than 20 times the previous general price subsidy — even though the net 
government subsidy expenditures are only about half as large (Goldemberg et al., 
2004). Another alternative to universal fuel subsidies is to provide pre-paid cards 
that could be used only for LPG purchases by qualifying households. 
When  it  is  specifically  energy-related,  financial  assistance  should  be  linked 
to  high  up-front  charges,  such  as  connection  charges,  which  impede  access 
and be carefully directed to the households that need it most. To be coherent 
with  demand-side  management  programmes,  financial  assistance  should  not, 
generally, be related to consumption. 
The total cost of some $18 billion needed to achieve access to electricity and to clean 
cooking stoves and cylinders in the ten countries analysed here is a mere 0.4% of the 
projected government take from oil and gas export revenues in 2006-2030. Table 15.6 
shows the variation by country. For example, Nigeria has a large number of people 
without access to modern energy services, but also has very large prospective oil and 
gas revenues. Cameroon will see its oil revenues decline over the projection period so 
that the share needed to expand access would be 13%, compared with 0.3% for Nigeria. 
Angola, with its small population and massive oil and gas revenues, would need to 
spend only 0.1% of oil and gas revenues to 2030 to see all of its citizens enjoy a minimal 
electricity service and cleaner cooking stoves. The cost as a share of government take 
is only 0.1% in Equatorial Guinea.

Managing revenues from oil and gas 
Investments in expanding energy access can reap long-term benefits to sustainable 
development. 15  But as long as affordability is a barrier to the uptake of modern energy 
services, the private sector will not have sufficient incentive to invest on the scale 
required.  Expanding  energy  access,  accordingly,  needs  to  be  a  policy  priority  for 
governments.  In  most  of  the  countries  assessed  here,  this  will  entail  fundamental 
political,  institutional  and  legislative  reform,  as  well  as  efforts  to  strengthen  the 
capability of regional and local authorities to implement programmes and to expand 
access to credit. Successful strategies to improve domestic energy access require good 
information on all the relevant topics, including plans for the development of domestic 
resources and infrastructure, and for hydrocarbon exports. High priority needs to be 
given to energy alongside health, education and other development objectives. 
The overall cost of expanding energy access, while large in absolute terms, is small 
compared with these countries’ potential earnings from oil and gas exports. Hydrocarbon 
revenues provide the means by which energy poverty can be overcome. Moreover, the era 
of high energy prices brings greater opportunity. Only a small proportion of the available 
revenues, after debt servicing, needs to be dedicated to energy-poverty alleviation, 
rather than dissipated in subsidies, military spending or corruption. 
Sound capture and management of hydrocarbon revenues requires efficient design 
of auctions and contracts, and transparent reporting by producers and governments 
(Humphreys et al., 2008). It is important that international standards be applied for 
negotiating and finalising contracts. Equally important are well-functioning systems 
15.  The link between energy and economic development is laid out in Chapter 10 in WEO-2004.

for ensuring ethical conduct in the public service. Only one African country, South 
Africa, features among the 37 countries that have ratified the OECD Anti-Bribery 
Convention  —  a  major  benchmark  in  the  international  battle  against  bribery  and 
corruption. These countries have introduced legislative amendments to strengthen 
their anti-bribery laws. 16
Several hydrocarbon-rich countries across the world have created sovereign wealth 
funds (SWFs) — state-owned investment funds composed of financial assets such as 
stocks, bonds, property or other financial instruments — as a means of improving the 
standard of living of every household in the longer term. The funding often comes 
from revenue generated from the export of natural resources. SWFs, however, may 
not be the right solution for low-income countries, especially those with rigidities in 
labour and capital markets. In countries without strong institutions, they may present 
undesirable opportunities for corruption and mismanagement. Given the scale of the 
challenge of poverty and development, countries could be better off investing their 
oil wealth in infrastructure, education and health. After initial mistakes in revenue 
management following the discovery of natural gas in the Netherlands (termed the 
“Dutch Disease”), the government there spent gas revenues on physical infrastructure 
projects,  such  as  bridges,  roads  and  communication,  paving  the  way  for  higher 
economic growth (termed the “Dutch Cure”). An abundance of resource wealth offers 
an  opportunity  for  economic  development  if  governments  manage  effectively  the 
wealth and the economic impacts of its application (Box 15.6). 
Box 15.6 z  Revenue management in Botswana: a success story
One of the world’s poorest countries at independence in 1966, Botswana has done 
remarkably well in using its mineral wealth, mainly from diamond resources, 
to  transform  the  economy.  Recognising  that  the  revenues  from  diamonds 
represented sales of a declining asset, the government of Botswana saw clearly 
the need for reinvestment of these revenues in order to sustain development. 
Botswana  adopted  a  policy  which  requires  that  all  mineral  revenues  be 
re-invested and devised its own rule-of-thumb for tracking this re-investment, 
the Sustainable Budget Index (SBI) (Lange and Wright, 2002). The amount of rent 
generated by mining and the share recovered by the government are reported, 
and the way government has used mineral rents is assessed in terms of the SBI. 
Botswana  has  used  these  revenues  to  effect  remarkable  improvements  in 
infrastructure, human capital and the basic services supplied to its population. 
GDP per capita in Botswana rose by 5.9% per year on average from 1996 to 2006, 
compared with an average decline of 7% per year for sub-Saharan African countries. 
Some 95% of the population in Botswana has access to an improved water source. 
Electricity access is estimated to be around 40%. Reliance on charcoal and fuelwood 
for cooking is some 65%, less than the share in seven of the countries assessed here.
16.  See the OECD Working Group on Bribery: Annual Report 2007 for more information.

376 World Energy Outlook 2008 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROSPECTS
The share of the population relying on fuelwood and charcoal for cooking in urban 
areas is less than 20%. Botswana joined the World Bank’s category of upper-
middle-income countries in the 1990s.
Botswana is widely considered to be an excellent example of effective resource 
management with future generations in mind. As a result of prudent management, 
not only has the domestic economy been developed but the country has also 
accumulated a substantial portfolio of international financial assets.
Much valuable experience is available in the management of income-generated natural 
resources. Norway’s experience is being used to help advance its Oil for Development 
programme.  Another  relevant  initiative  is  the  Extractive  Industry  Transparency 
Initiative (EITI), supporting improved governance in resource-rich countries through 
the  verification  and  publication  of  company  payments  and  government  revenues 
from oil, gas and mining. Among the countries analysed here, Cameroon, Congo, Côte 
d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Nigeria have met the conditions to become 
candidate countries in the EITI. Public access to reliable, verified information is a basic 
condition of improved accountability by governments for funds derived from resource 
exploitation; permitting public verification that revenues from this source are actually 
used  for  the  purposes  of  the  fight  against  poverty  and  the  implementation  of  the 
Millennium Development Goals.

THE ROLE OF
ENERGY IN

PREFACE
In an attempt to inform the global negotiations on a climate-change agreement, which 
are due to culminate in Copenhagen at the end of next year, this part of the Outlook 
analyses the interaction of energy and the climate. 
Chapter 16 sets out the implications for greenhouse-gas emissions of the Reference 
Scenario  examined  in  Part  A.  It  shows  the  evolution  of  energy-related  greenhouse-
gas emissions through to 2030 and puts it in the broader context of emissions from all 
sources. It explains the relationship between the level of annual emissions and the long-
term concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will determine the 
increase in the future global average temperature. The prospective temperature rise 
goes well beyond what the international community now regards as acceptable.
Change in the energy sector is an essential component of an acceptable, alternative 
outcome — but it is only one component. Chapter 17 looks at what overall emissions- 
limitation  level  the  international  community  might  decide  upon,  how  that  would 
translate back into an atmospheric concentration of CO
2
-equivalent gases and what 
means might be used to achieve stabilisation of that concentration. It also sets out the 
analytical framework for our modelling of energy and emissions in two scenarios: the 
550 Policy Scenario, in which greenhouse-gas concentration is stabilised at 550 parts 
per million of CO
2
-eq, and a 450 Policy Scenario, in which concentration is limited to 
450 ppm CO
2
-eq.
Chapter 18 sets out in detail the projections of energy demand and supply and emissions 
in  the  two  climate-policy  scenarios,  by  sector  and  by  major  regional  group.  They 
provide a picture of the policy responses and technological transformation that would 
be required, in each case, to meet the climate goal, through a plausible combination of 
cap-and-trade, sectoral agreements and national policies and measures. 
Finally, Chapter 19 assesses the implications of those scenarios for investment in the 
energy sector and how an efficient global carbon market could help minimise costs and 
so contribute to the realisation of the international community’s agreed objectives.

CHAPTER 16
IMPLICATIONS OF THE REFERENCE 
SCENARIO FOR THE GLOBAL CLIMATE
Where would policy inaction leave us?
The  Reference  Scenario  describes  a  future  based  on  established  trends  and   z
policies, without new initiatives by governments on energy security or climate 
change. In this baseline scenario, rising global fossil-fuel use continues to drive 
up energy-related CO
2
 emissions, from 28 Gt in 2006 to 41 Gt in 2030 — an 
increase of 45%.  
Some 97% of the global increase in energy-related CO  z
2
 emissions to 2030 arises 
in non-OECD countries. China (6.1 Gt), India (2 Gt), and the Middle East (1.3 Gt) 
together account for three-quarters of the increase. Cities in non-OECD countries 
account for half of the world’s energy-related CO
2
 emissions in 2030, up from 
38% today. Emissions in the OECD group of countries peak after 2020 and then 
decline. Only in Europe and Japan are emissions in 2030 lower than today. 
In the 1980s, global energy-related CO  z
2
 emissions rose more slowly than primary 
energy demand but this decarbonisation of the energy sector started to slow and 
reverse in the 1990s, as the share of nuclear power fell back while that of coal 
rose. The Reference Scenario projects the continuation of this recarbonisation 
until after 2020, before energy demand growth once again outpaces emissions 
growth. 
The power-generation and transport sectors contribute over 70% of the projected   z
increase in world energy-related CO
2
 emissions to 2030. The projected increase in 
power sector emissions for the OECD — 0.4 Gt between 2006 and 2030 — is less than 
the increase in emissions from China’s power plants in the past two years alone.
Per-capita  energy-related  CO  z
2
  emissions  in  OECD  countries  are  6%  lower  on 
average  in  2030  than  today.  In  non-OECD  countries,  they  increase  markedly. 
China’s emissions reach those of Europe by around 2025, at more than 7 tonnes 
per  capita,  and  the  Middle  East  surpasses  Japan  by  2030,  at  over  9  tonnes. 
Despite a 15% decline, per-capita emissions in the United States, at 16 tonnes, 
are the highest of any country bar Russia in 2030.
World greenhouse-gas emissions, including non-energy CO  z
2
 and all other gases, 
are projected to grow from 44 Gt CO
2
-equivalent in 2005 to 60 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030, 
an increase of 35% over 2005. The share of energy-related CO
2
 emissions in total 
greenhouse-gas emissions increases from 61% in 2005 to 68% in 2030.

382 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
As  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  build  up  in  the  atmosphere  faster  than  natural   z
processes can remove them, their concentrations rise. The Reference Scenario puts us 
on a path to doubling the aggregate concentration in CO
2
 equivalent terms by the end 
of this century, entailing an eventual global average temperature increase up to 6°C.
Air pollution is projected to decline slightly over the   z Outlook period, though not in all 
regions. Reduced emissions of pollutant aerosols bring considerable benefits to human 
health, but also a reduction in their associated cooling effect on the climate.
Projected trends in energy-related CO
2
 emissions
Overview
In the Reference Scenario, rising global use of fossil energy is set to continue to drive 
up energy-related carbon-dioxide (CO
2
) emissions over at least the next two decades 
(Figure 16.1). A range of government policies, including those intended to address 
climate change, air pollution and energy security, has helped to slow the rate of growth 
in emissions in some countries in recent years.  In most countries, however, emissions 
are still rising fast. World energy-related CO
2
 emissions grew by 2.5 Gigatonnes (billion 
tonnes, Gt) from 1990 to 2000; by 2006 they had shot up a further 4.5 Gt to reach 
28 Gt. In the Reference Scenario, which takes account only of government policies 
adopted before mid-2008, 1  emissions jump by 45% to 41 Gt in 2030, an average rate 
of growth of 1.6% per year. By comparison, emissions grew by 1.8% per year between 
1990 and 2006. Non-OECD countries account for almost all of the projected growth 
in world emissions to 2030. Projected world emissions in 2030 are nonetheless 1.4 Gt 
(3.2%) lower than in last year’s Outlook, mainly because fossil-energy demand grows 
less quickly (Box 16.1).

Energy-related  CO
2
  emissions  are  3.2%  lower  in  2030  than  projected  in  last 
year’s WEO, due to significantly lower consumption of fossil fuels, mainly oil. 
Our higher price assumptions for fossil fuels, again notably oil, stimulate more 
energy conservation and faster uptake of more efficient end-use technologies. 
They also promote faster deployment of low-carbon supply-side technologies, 
such as renewables and nuclear power. In addition, a number of new government 
policies and measures have been implemented since mid-2007 and are taken into 
account in this year’s Reference Scenario, tempering the growth in fossil-fuel 
consumption. 
Lower  CO
2
  emissions  growth  in  OECD  countries  (0.1%  per  year  2006-2030, 
compared with 0.6% 2005-2030 in WEO-2007) results from a combination of higher 
energy prices, lower GDP assumptions and new policies introduced since last year 
and now included in the Reference Scenario. Oil demand is most affected, cutting 
total CO
2
 emissions in 2030 by 1.4 Gt compared with WEO-2007. In WEO-2008, 
OECD emissions peak after 2020 and decline thereafter.
Emissions grow more slowly in all three OECD regions. In non-OECD countries, 
the changes vary more by region. This year’s Outlook assumes faster economic 
growth  in  the  major  energy-exporting  countries,  leading  to  faster  emissions 
growth,  particularly  in  the  Middle  East.  Emissions  in  most  other  non-OECD 
regions, however, grow at a slightly slower rate than was projected last year. 
They  nonetheless  still  account  for  around  two-thirds  of  emissions  in  2030. 
Emissions  in  non-OECD  countries  in  aggregate  have  been  rising  fast  in  recent 
years, despite rapidly rising prices (Table 16.1).

384 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
In the 1980s, global energy-related CO
2
 emissions rose more slowly than primary energy 
demand, mainly because the shares of natural gas, nuclear power and renewables in 
the power mix expanded. On average, emissions grew by 1.7% per year between 1980 
and  2006,  while  energy  use  rose  by  1.9%.  However,  this  “decarbonisation”  of  the 
energy sector started to slow and reverse in the 1990s, as the share of nuclear power 
fell back while that of coal rose. In the Reference Scenario, “recarbonisation” of the 
energy sector is projected to continue until after 2020, when a changing supply pattern 
enables the rate of growth in emissions (Figure 16.2) once again to fall below the rate 
of growth of primary energy demand. Global carbon intensity — measured by tonnes of 
energy-related CO
2
 emitted per thousand dollars of GDP at constant purchasing power 
parity — is projected to decline from 0.45 tonnes in 2006 to 0.35 tonnes in 2020 and 
to 0.30 tonnes in 2030, with intensity falling in all regions. But energy-related CO
2
 
emissions continue to rise, in absolute terms, as the world becomes wealthier.

Historical  patterns  of  energy-related  CO

  emissions  vary  widely  across  the  globe

1990  and  2006,  while  the  Czech  Republic,  Germany,  Hungary,  Poland,  the  Slovak 
Republic,  Sweden  and  the  United  Kingdom  reduced  their  emissions  over  the  same 
period. OECD emissions overall increased by 16% between 1990 and 2006, while those 
of non-OECD countries in aggregate shot up by 52%, in line with their faster economic 
growth, causing emissions from non-OECD countries as a whole to overtake those of 
OECD  countries  in  2005.  Emissions  in  some  countries,  mostly  in  the  former  Soviet 
Union, actually fell during the same period, as their economies underwent massive 
restructuring (Table 16.2). In contrast, China overtook the United States in 2007 as the 
world’s largest emitter of energy-related CO
2
. One reason for China’s high emissions 
is the CO
2
 “embedded” in its exports, which far outweighs the CO
2
 embedded in its 
imports (see Spotlight). For non-OECD countries in general, urbanisation is a major 
driver of CO
2
 emissions growth (Box 16.2).

for  49%  of  the  global  increase  in  emissions  and  India  for  17%,  reflecting  the  rapid

those of all OECD regions combined (Figure 16.4).

How much of the world’s energy-related CO
2
 emissions
are “embedded” in internationally traded goods and services?
In the World Energy Outlook, CO
2
 emissions are attributed to the country or 
region in which the fossil fuel from which the emissions arise is consumed, 
in  accordance  with  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change  (UNFCCC)  inventory  reporting  guidelines  (for  the  same  reason, 
emissions  from  international  aviation  and  shipping  are  also  excluded). 
Yet the consumption benefits from goods and services produced are often 
realised in a country other than that in which the emissions arose. This is 
an issue of concern to some emerging economies, which tend to be more 
export-orientated  and  whose  exports  tend  to  consist  of  more  energy-
intensive manufactured goods. The concept should not be confused with 
carbon  leakage  as  defined  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change (IPCC), which refers only to changes in emissions resulting directly 
from  climate  policy  (Box  17.3).  A  consumption-based  accounting  system 
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to design, while the current 
S P O T L I G H T

Chapter 16 - Implications of the Reference Scenario for the global climate 387
16
system  based  on  emissions  within  national  borders  has  the  important 
advantage of simplicity. Nevertheless, a brief examination of the issue can 
be informative.
There  are  a  number  of  ways  of  calculating  the  emissions  embedded  in 
international  trade,  none  of  them  perfectly  accurate  due  to  the  lack  of 
complete,  reliable  and  up-to-date  data.  Energy  and  energy-related  CO
2
 
emissions are embedded in imports as well as exports, and some goods and 
services are more emissions-intensive than others. A detailed input-output 
analysis  of  China  was  published  in  WEO-2007,  tracking  the  distribution 
of  fuels,  raw  materials  and  intermediate  goods  to  and  from  industries 
throughout  the  economy.  The  analysis  took  carbon  intensities  and  trade 
data into account and estimated energy-related CO
2
 emissions embedded in 
domestic production for export to be 34% of total 2004 emissions (IEA, 2007). 
Input-output analysis is highly complex because it involves the calculation 
of carbon intensity all along the production chain and across the economy, 
including outsourcing (Houser et al., 2008). Moreover, even such a detailed 
analysis might not accurately reflect the situation in a country such as China, 
where production facilities are expanding at a rapid pace.
At the global level, a much simpler methodology is necessary. The percentage 
of exports in GDP can be used as a simple proxy for the share of energy-
related CO
2
 emissions that are embedded in domestic production for export. 
The countries for which up-to-date trade data is available represent 83% of 
total world energy CO
2
 emissions. Grouping those countries into eight regions 
(Figure 16.5), our estimate of the share of emissions embedded in exports 
in 2006 ranges from 15% for North America to 48% for the Middle East. The 
difference  reflects  variations  in  the  amount  and  type  of  exports  and  the 
carbon intensity of energy use. The shares for China (44%) and Asian countries 
other  than  China  and  India  (41%)  are  next  highest  after  the  Middle  East, 
though for different reasons. Of the 23 Gt of energy-related CO
2
 emissions 
in  our  sample,  one-third  was  embedded  in  production  for  export.  China 
alone accounted for 2.3 Gt (31%) of this, with Europe and Russia combined 
responsible for another 1.7 Gt (23%). Africa and Latin America each accounted 
for just 2% of the total embedded emissions. 
For China at least, the proxy seems to be a reasonable one, i.e. the carbon 
content  of  China’s  exports  is  similar  to  that  of  its  domestic  consumption 
and investment (Weber et al., 2008). Weber et al. find that in 2005, 33% of 
China’s CO
2
 emissions were embedded in exports. Although that is a smaller 
percentage than in our analysis, they find that the share has been steadily 
increasing,  from  12%  in  1987.  The  share  of  total  energy  use  and  carbon 
emissions embedded in international trade is likely to fall over the projection 
period  if  emerging  economies,  such  as  China,  become  more  orientated 
towards their domestic markets.

Trends per capita and per unit of GDP 
World CO
2
 emissions per capita had been declining until around 2000 but have risen 
rapidly since. This upward trend is set to continue through to 2030 (Table 16.3). The 
OECD currently has higher average per-capita emissions than non-OECD regions (though 
the range is wide between non-OECD countries). In 2006, per-capita emissions in the 
United States amounted to 18.6 tonnes, followed by Russia with 11 tonnes, Japan with 
9.5 tonnes and the European Union with 8 tonnes. China’s per-capita emissions were 
4.3 tonnes (close to the global average, but 40% of the level of the OECD), while in India 
they were 1.1 tonnes and a mere 0.9 tonnes in Africa. United States, Japanese and EU 
per-capita emissions are expected to fall, though not dramatically, over the Reference 
Scenario projection period. In 2030, Russia’s per-capita emissions are projected to 
have overtaken those of the United States, while China’s are likely to exceed those 
of Europe. Africa’s per-capita emissions, on the other hand, are only one-sixth of the 
world average in 2030. 
OECD countries today have lower CO
2
 emissions per unit of GDP (in year-2007 dollars 
at  market  exchange  rates)  than  non-OECD  countries.  Emissions  per  unit  of  GDP 
decline in both groups of countries over the Outlook period, but the decline is faster 
in non-OECD countries than in OECD countries (Figure 16.6).  Nevertheless, by 2030, 
CO
2
 emissions per unit of GDP in OECD countries are three times lower than in non-
OECD countries.

These projections hinge critically on GDP growth assumptions. In the recent past, many 
energy projections — including our own — failed to anticipate the full magnitude of the 
surge in economic growth in China. If growth worldwide were to turn out to be a lot 
faster than we assume, per-capita emissions would rise even faster than projected.

2
 emissions 
(Figure 16.7). The share of global CO
2
 emissions in cities is higher than that 
for energy use because as developing countries urbanise, they tend to shift 
from biomass and waste (assumed to be CO
2
 neutral) to more CO
2
-intensive 
energy sources. Since city residents also tend to consume more energy than 
rural residents, they therefore emit more CO
2
 per capita. This, coupled with 
the projected increase in global urbanisation, produces a Reference Scenario 
trend towards an increasing proportion of global CO
2
 emissions from cities. The 
implementation of new climate-change policies in cities is therefore especially 
important (see Chapter 17).
In the Reference Scenario, CO
2
 emissions from cities increase at 1.8% per annum, 
faster than global CO
2
 emissions at 1.6%. By 2030, it is projected that almost
30.8 Gt will be emitted in the world’s cities, a 55% increase over 2006 levels by 
2030, the equivalent of adding twice the entire emissions of the United States. 
The share of cities in global CO
2
-emissions by 2030 is 76%. As is the case for energy 
use, the vast majority (89%) of CO
2
-emissions growth in cities through the Outlook 
period comes from non-OECD countries. Cities in non-OECD countries account for 
two-thirds of the global CO
2
 emissions in 2030, up from 53% today.
On a regional basis, CO
2
 emissions closely follow energy use in OECD countries. 
In  cities  in  the  United  States,  CO
2
  emissions  in  2006  were  4.5  Gt  and  reach
5 Gt by 2030, maintaining roughly the same share as city energy consumption 
throughout the projection period. Cities in the EU are projected to increase their 
CO
2
 emissions from 2.7 Gt in 2006 to 2.9 Gt by 2030, growing at 0.2% per annum, 
while CO
2
 emissions for the EU as a whole actually decrease by 0.2% per annum. 
This sees cities’ share of total EU CO
2
 emissions increase from 69% today to 77% 
by the end of the projection period. Australasian cities are projected to increase 
from 0.34 Mt in 2006 to 0.38 Mt of CO
2
 emissions by 2030, maintaining roughly the 
same share as city energy consumption through the projection period.
However, the trend is very different in non-OECD countries, typified by China. 
The share of energy-related CO
2
 emissions in Chinese cities, at 86% in 2006, is 
higher than that of energy consumption. This is due to increased consumption of 
fossil fuels and lower consumption of traditional biomass. Emissions of 4.8 Gt in 
2006 are projected to increase to 10.3 Gt by 2030, growing faster than national 
CO
2
 emissions, at 3.2% per annum.

Power generation
Fossil-fuel power plants emitted 11.4 Gt of CO
2
 in 2006, 41% of the world total. This 
share has been rising steadily, from 36% in 1990 and 39% in 2000, and continues to 
grow in the Reference Scenario, to 44% in 2020 and 45% in 2030. Power-sector CO
2
 
emissions reach 16 Gt in 2020 and 18 Gt in 2030. Cumulatively, power generation 
contributes over half the increase in energy-related CO
2
 emissions to 2030 in the 
Reference Scenario. This growth is driven by the relatively rapid growth in demand 
for electricity and in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal, in power generation  
(see Chapter 6). Emissions from coal-fired power plants reached 8.3 Gt in 2006 and 
are projected to rise further to 12.1 Gt by 2020 and 13.5 Gt by 2030 — nearly three-
quarters of total power sector emissions.
Nearly  all  of  the  increase  in  power-sector  CO
2
  emissions  is  expected  to  come
from non-OECD countries, where rising electricity demand and increased reliance
on coal are particularly pronounced (Figure 16.8). Having emitted 6.5 Gt of CO
2
 in 
2006,  non-OECD  power  sector  emissions  are  projected  to  double  by  2030.  In  the 
OECD,  CO
2
  emissions  rise  by  only  a  small  percentage  over  the  projection  period 
because electricity demand growth is more restrained than in non-OECD countries 
and because more gas and renewable energy enters the fuel mix at the expense
of oil and coal. The projected total increase for the OECD between 2006 and 2030 — 0.4 Gt —
is  less  than  the  increase  in  emissions  from  China’s  power  plants  in  the  past
two years.
World average emissions per MWh of electricity generated fall slightly as a result 
of  continuing  gains  in  the  thermal  efficiency  of  power  plants  and  greater  use  of 
renewables (Figure 16.9). However, these savings are not nearly large enough to 
outweigh the increase in electricity demand.

Transport contributed 23% of world energy-related CO

emissions  falls  slightly.  Transport  contributes  one-fifth  of  the  increase  in  global 
emissions to 2030, growing from 6.4 Gt in 2006 to 8.9 Gt in 2030 (Table 16.4). The two 
main drivers of growth are increasing vehicle ownership and use in non-OECD countries 
and increasing international travel, in the form of passenger aviation and navigation 
(marine freight) (Figure 16.10). Almost 0.4 Gt of the increase is from international 
marine bunkers and international aviation, whose emissions together grow to 1.4 Gt by 
2030. These emissions are not included in UNFCCC inventories.

In  OECD  countries,  road-transport  related  CO
2
  emissions  are  expected  to  be 
broadly flat through to 2030. This contrasts sharply with the increase seen over 
the  past  25 years.  The  vehicle  stock 2   in  OECD  countries  is  projected  to  rise 
by  30%  (almost  200  million  vehicles)  by  2030,  much  less  than  the  three-fold 
increase  (almost  770 million vehicles)  projected  for  non-OECD  countries  (see 
Chapter  3).  Average  LDV  fleet  CO
2
  emissions  in  OECD  countries  are  projected 
to fall from 176 g per kilometre in 2006 to 133 g/km in 2030. This results from 
incremental  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of  internal  combustion  engines, 
increased penetration of biofuels and the continued uptake of hybrid vehicles. 
These  efficiency  improvements  are  already  starting  to  be  realised,  as  high  oil 
prices begin to change consumer preferences in OECD countries. In the United 
States, light truck sales took a sharp downturn in early 2008, being replaced by 
smaller passenger cars, and the share of hybrids in total vehicle sales passed 3% 
for the first time (Green Car Congress, 2008). Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) have 
seen a sharp decline in sales — especially in the United States. Globally, however, 
improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency are not enough to compensate for the 
increase in traffic volume over the Outlook period. 
Aviation accounted for 11% of world transport emissions in 2006, almost equally 
split between domestic and international travel. Its share increases to around 13% 
in 2030 in the Reference Scenario. Recent increases in fuel prices are encouraging

companies  to  streamline  airline  operations  and  to  replace  old,  inefficient 
aircraft more quickly than previously. However, despite higher fuel prices and 
a  corresponding  increase  in  ticket  prices,  air  passenger  volumes  increased  by 
around one-third from 2004 to 2007 (Airbus, 2007). The number of commercial 
aircraft is projected to rise from 18 000 in 2006 to around 44 000 in 2030. Over 
three-quarters of the current fleet is expected to be retired by 2030 and the new 
generation of large aircraft that is introduced between now and 2030 is expected 
to be around 50% more efficient per passenger-kilometre than the current fleet. 
Alternatives to oil-based fuels in the airline sector are less advanced than for road 
transport, although some in-flight testing of biofuel blends has been undertaken. 
We therefore assume that the aircraft fleet remains entirely dependent on oil 
over the Outlook period.

from 1990 to 2006, but between 2002 and 2006 they grew more rapidly, at 5% per

other energy-intensive industries in China. In the Reference Scenario, global industry-

2
 emissions grow by 1.4% per year to 6.4 Gt in 2030 (Figure 16.11). While

industrial sector increases slightly, from 56% in 2006 to 60% in 2030, driven entirely by 
non-OECD countries. Iron and steel production contributes most — around one-third — 
to the increase in industrial emissions, followed by non-metallic minerals, chemicals 
and petrochemicals production.

In OECD countries, industry CO
2
 emissions declined by 0.9% per year between 1990 and 
2006. Although value added in the industrial sector is projected to grow by 1% per year 
between 2006 and 2030, industrial energy demand grows by only 0.3% per year and direct 
emissions actually decline, by 0.4% per year, due to switching to less carbon-intensive 
fuels and electricity. Rising fuel prices are expected to promote the use of more energy-
efficient  manufacturing  technologies.  In  non-OECD  countries,  where  value  added  in 
industry is assumed to grow by 4.3% per year, industry CO
2
 emissions rise by 2.1% per 
year over the Outlook period. Nearly half of the additional CO
2
 emissions in industry 
come from China and a further one-quarter from India. In China, the bulk of this growth 
comes from the iron and steel industry, though the increase in emissions from this sector 
decelerates progressively.  In India, industry emissions grow at 4.9% per year, faster than 
in any other region, with coal’s share rising from 66% in 2006 to 81% in 2030.
The iron and steel, chemical and petrochemical, non-metallic minerals, and paper, 
pulp and print industries accounted for 65% of global emissions from industry in 2006. 
The share declines over the projection period to 61% in 2030 as production in less 
energy-intensive sectors grows faster. 
Residential, services and agricultural sectors
At the world level, the agriculture sector was directly responsible for 2% of energy-
related CO
2
 emissions in 2006, the services sector for 3% and the residential sector for 
7%. Together, these “buildings” sectors contribute 5% of the total increase in global 
emissions to 2030, with growth coming mainly from increased floor space in buildings 
of various types, especially in non-OECD countries. In China, for example, average 
floor space per capita is projected to increase from 24 m 2  in 2006 to 37 m 2  in 2030. The 
increase in ownership of energy-consuming home appliances, both in OECD countries 
and in large emerging countries, is also a contributing factor. 
Final (direct) energy consumption in these sectors grows by 1.5% per year between 
2006 and 2030 in non-OECD countries, compared with a negligible increase in OECD 
countries. The very low retirement rate of the building stock in the OECD, with typical

lifetimes of more than 40 years (IEA, 2008), keeps CO
2
 emissions per square metre at 
relatively high levels, because the Reference Scenario assumes that heating demand in 
old, poorly insulated buildings is met mainly through the use of fossil fuels.
When power sector CO
2
 emissions associated with the electricity consumed in buildings 
are taken into account, the residential sector accounted for 17% of the 2006 world 
total. This sum of direct and indirect emissions increases by 40% between 2006 and 
2030, accounting for 15% of the total increase in global emissions to 2030. The most 
rapid growth in household demand between 2006 and 2030 comes from appliances, 
with electricity demand growing at 1.1% per year in OECD countries and 3.7% per year 
in non-OECD countries. In the OECD, appliances account for 73% of the increase in 
energy-related CO
2
 emissions in the residential sector, space heating for 21%, lighting 
for 5% and water heating for 1%.
Most new buildings will be constructed in non-OECD countries during the coming decades 
and  non-OECD  buildings  therefore  account  for  88%  of  the  total  increase  in  building 
emissions  worldwide,  though  the  introduction  of  building  codes  (standards  for  new 
building efficiency) slows the rate of growth. Non-OECD CO
2
 emissions from buildings 
(including indirect emissions) grow in total from 3.9 Gt to 7.0 Gt in 2030, a rate of 2.4% 
per annum, while emissions in OECD countries grow at just 0.4% per year between 2006 
and 2030. These figures reflect lower direct use of coal and oil for domestic heating and 
cooking in OECD countries and strong growth in gas consumption in non-OECD countries 
— driven partly by switching from traditional biomass (Figure 16.12).
In the services sector, world CO
2
 emissions (direct and indirect) grow by 1.7% per year 
between 2006 and 2030. Total residential emissions grow by 1.4% per year over this 
period, reflecting slower growth in energy demand for residential buildings compared 
to commercial ones.

Projected trends in overall greenhouse-gas emissions
The  World  Energy  Outlook  has  for  several  years  presented  projections  of  energy-
related CO
2
 emissions, based on our fossil-energy demand projections. The burning of 
coal, oil and gas is expected to be the main source of growth in CO
2
 emissions in the 
coming decades (Box 16.3). Nonetheless, non-energy related emissions of CO
2
 (notably 
from  land-use  changes  such  as  deforestation  and  the  chemical  process  of  cement 
manufacture) and emissions of other greenhouse gases 3  from all sectors will remain 
important. Together, these sources currently account for 39% of total greenhouse-
gas emissions. The significance of our energy projections for the concentration in the 
atmosphere of greenhouse gases in total, and so for climate change, can be understood 
only if these non-energy emissions are taken into account. This year’s Outlook includes 
an assessment of the total emissions picture for the first time.
Box 16.3 z  Greenhouse-gas emissions data and projections
Historical  energy-related  CO
2
  emission  estimates  are  derived  from  energy 
consumption data, taken from the proprietary databases of the IEA. Projections 
of energy demand and associated CO
2
 emissions are then made using the World 
Energy  Model  (see  www.worldenergyoutlook.org  for  more  details).  Land-use 
emissions data are taken from the latest OECD Environmental Outlook (OECD, 
2008).  Emissions  data  for  2005  with  projections  out  to  2020  for  non-energy-
related CO
2
 and for all non-CO
2
 gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol have been 
provided to the IEA by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 4  
A range of original sources was used by the EPA to prepare this database, using 
the latest information available. The data was categorised into the 16 countries 
and regions used in this Outlook. Most other gases, including ozone precursors 
(nitrogen  oxides  [NO
x
],  carbon  monoxide  [CO],  non-methane  volatile  organic 
compounds, sulphur dioxide [SO
2
]), CFCs and aerosols, were not considered. 
All  greenhouse  gases  are  converted  to  tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent 
(CO
2
-eq),  using  their  100-year  global  warming  potentials  as  evaluated  by  the 
IPCC (2007). The climate-carbon cycle model MAGICC (Version 5.3) was used to 
give longer-term projections of all greenhouse-gas emissions out to 2100 and 
beyond,  and  to  calculate  the  atmospheric  stocks  and  eventual  concentration 
levels that would result. Other models, including IMAGE 2.4 from the Netherlands 
Environmental Assessment Agency, were used to verify the emissions assumptions, 
particularly for land-use CO
2
.
3.  The main long-lived gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, other than CO
2
, are methane (CH
4
), nitrogen dioxi-
de (N
2
O), perﬂ uorocarbons (PFCs), hydroﬂ uorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexaﬂ uride (SF
6
), chloroﬂ uorocarbons 
(CFCs) and hydrochloroﬂ uorocarbons (HCFCs). The latter two are dealt with under the international Montreal 
Protocol relating to ozone-depleting substances.
4.   EPA projections of emissions go out only as far as 2020, so linear extrapolations were made out to 2030. The 
data reported in this section were used in the Reference Scenario multi-gas analysis.

398 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Estimating non-energy emissions is difficult and so projections of them are subject 
to wide ranges of uncertainty (IPCC, 2007). There is also considerable uncertainty 
about the degree of radiative forcing of many of the non-CO
2
 greenhouse gases, 
as well as the offsetting cooling effects of other gases, such as anthropogenic 
aerosols (very small particulates). 5  Data on the additional effects of non-sulphur 
aerosols,  tropospheric  ozone  and  stratospheric  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  from 
aircraft are even weaker.
In 2005, global greenhouse-gas emissions amounted to 44.2 Gt of CO
2
-eq. 6  The main 
gases are CO
2
, CH
4
 and N
2
O. In terms of CO
2
-equivalent, together they account for 
almost  99%  of  anthropogenic  greenhouse-gas  emissions  (Figure  16.13).  CO
2
  is  the 
dominant  gas,  accounting  for  around  81%  of  CO
2
-equivalent  global  greenhouse-gas 
emissions.  Energy-related  CO
2
  accounts  for  61%  of  all  greenhouse  gases  in  CO
2
-
equivalent terms and for 76% of total CO
2
 emissions.

 from industry and land-use change accounts for the largest share of non-energy 
related greenhouse-gas emissions. Land use, land use change and forests (LULUCF) is 
a broad category that includes a range of emitting activities such as deforestation, 
unsustainable use of traditional biomass, burning of scrubland, decay of biomass after 
logging, peat fires, decay of drained peat soils and loss of organic matter from soils 
after cultivation. It represents the largest non-energy source, being 19% of total CO
2
 
emissions  or  15%  of  total  greenhouse-gas  emissions.  Other  leading  sources  of  non-
energy emissions are cement production and natural gas flaring that together account 
for around 4% of total greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Methane  is  the  second-largest  contributor  to  greenhouse  gases,  with  most  of  the 
emissions coming from leakages during natural gas extraction and distribution, and 
from farming. Methane from the energy and waste sectors accounts for about 6% of 
total greenhouse-gas emissions, with a similar percentage coming from the agriculture 
sector. The share of ozone-depleting fluorinated “F-gases” in total greenhouse-gas 
emission is only about 1%. 7  Nitrous oxide, mainly from agriculture but also from industry 
and waste, with small amounts from energy use, accounts for most of the remaining 
non-energy related greenhouse-gas emissions.
By sector, agriculture accounts for half of all methane emissions, 95% of total nitrous 
oxide, and around 60% of all non-CO
2
 gases. These agricultural emissions are influenced 
by population growth, increased calorific intake per capita, dietary changes to more 
meat and milk products, crop yields and the intensity of agricultural production and 
farm management methods. 
In the Reference Scenario, total greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to increase by 
about 35%, from 44.2 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2005 to 59.6 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030 (Figure 16.14). Non-
CO
2
 emissions, which arise mainly in the agricultural sector, are projected to increase, 
but at a slightly lower rate than the 50% increase in energy CO
2
 emissions. Industry 
CO
2
 emissions increase at a similar rate whereas land-use CO
2
 emissions, mainly from 
deforestation, are projected to decline. 
Excluding energy-related CO
2
, emissions are projected to increase by 11% between 
2005 and 2030. By volume, methane emissions increase the most — from 5.7 Gt CO
2
-eq 
in  2005  to  8.2  Gt  CO
2
-eq.  Most  of  the  increase  comes  from  wastewater,  ruminant 
digestion, coal mines and leakages from pipelines due to rising global gas demand. 
Gas  leakages  have  been  reduced  in  OECD  countries  (where  higher  gas  prices  have 
increased the incentive to do so) and there are moves to reduce flaring and venting in 
several producing countries. N
2
O emissions grow by around 41%, especially those from 
nitrogenous fertilizer use. F-gases more than double during the period, mainly due to 
continuing replacement of ozone-depleting substances by HFCs, causing a three-fold 
increase of the latter by 2030. 
7.  Emissions of ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol reached a peak of about 
7.5 Gt CO
2
-eq (20% of total GHG emissions) in 1990 but then decreased signiﬁ cantly as they were replaced 
by the F-gases. Some of these F-gases cause warming directly; others are produced with methods that yield 
strong warming by-products. This decrease is expected to continue as CFCs are phased out in developing 
countries.

There are large differences in projected emissions of greenhouse gases other than 
energy-related CO
2
 across regions (Figure 16.15). In OECD countries, methane emissions 
from landfills decline by 2030 due to greater capture and use of the gas, while in non-
OECD countries this technology is taken up more slowly and emissions continue to rise. 
Agricultural emissions increase proportionately more in Africa, China, Eastern Europe/
Eurasia and Latin America, where there is greater scope for more intensive farming 
through  better  farm  management  and  additional  fertilizer  use.  In  OECD  countries, 
these emissions begin to decline due to advanced, precision application of fertilizer, 
use  of  soil  nitrogen  inhibitors  and  reduction  of  ruminant  methane.  SF
6
  emissions 
increase in regions where the power generation sector is expanding. PFC emissions 
tend to fall by 2030 except in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, whereas HFC 
emissions increase virtually everywhere.

Long-term greenhouse-gas concentrations
and average global temperature 
The  concentration  of  CO
2
  in  the  atmosphere  has  risen  from  around  280  ppm  in
pre-industrial times to 385 ppm and continues to rise today. This level exceeds by far 
the natural range over the last 650 000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from 
ice cores, seabed sediment cores and tree ring records. Methane concentrations 
have increased from 715 to 1 774 parts per billion over the same period. The total 
CO
2
-equivalent concentration 8  of all long-lived greenhouse gases, taking into account 
land-use change, is currently around 455 ppm. This is around 60% higher than the 
level in pre-industrial times.
As a general rule, higher greenhouse-gas emissions lead to higher greenhouse-gas 
concentrations. 9  These in turn lead to rising global temperatures and more severe 
climatic  consequences.  However,  the  links  between  emissions  of  greenhouse 
gases and climate change are extremely complex and factors such as carbon sinks, 
albedo (solar heat reflection) effects, cloud cover, land-use change and aerosols 
can possibly partially neutralise these effects (IPCC, 2007). Nonetheless, it is clear 
that the rapid growth of greenhouse-gas emissions, as projected in the Reference 
Scenario, would lead to a substantial long-term increase in global temperatures. 
The present average global temperature is estimated to be 0.76 o C higher than the 
pre-industrial level. The rate of temperature change has accelerated, rising to about 
0.19 o C over the past two decades. The temperature increase per decade is more 
than twice as fast as that observed over the preceding hundred years. 
Our projected increase in energy-related CO
2
 emissions to 2030 lies in the middle of 
the range of CO
2
-equivalent emissions scenarios that have been modelled, assuming 
an absence of new climate policies (IPCC, 2007), with respect to both emissions 
and  concentrations  (Figure  16.16).  Most  of  these  scenarios  project  emissions  to 
continue to rise during this century. The projected CO
2
 emissions are also consistent 
with model outputs of concentrations from MAGICC (Version 5.3). Atmospheric CO
2
 
concentrations by around the end of the next century are in line with the 660 to 790 
ppm CO
2
 (855 to 1 130 ppm CO
2
-eq) ranges assessed from the five scenarios considered 
(IPCC,  2007).  This  leads  to  a  temperature  rise  above  pre-industrial  levels  of
about 6 o C. 
8.  The concentrations of greenhouse gases other than CO
2
 in the atmosphere can be measured in terms 
of the equivalent CO
2
 concentration that would result in the same level of radiative forcing. Today, their 
additional warming effect is largely offset by the cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols and troposphe-
ric ozone. The current overall warming effect is therefore considered to be similar to that of CO
2
 alone 
(385 ppm), though this result is very uncertain.
9.  1 ppm of atmospheric CO
2
 today mathematically equates to around 7.7 Gt CO
2
. In the past 50 years, 
around 58% of all the CO
2
 emitted has stayed in the atmosphere — the rest has been removed over different 
timescales by various processes, including absorption by oceans and the biosphere, or has been broken down 
(Hansen, 2005). Consequently, at the present levels of atmospheric concentration, each additional 13.3 Gt 
of CO
2
-equivalent gases released corresponds to an approximate increase in concentration of around 1 ppm. 
This may change in the future as some of the removal processes reach saturation.

The world is already experiencing the ill-effects of rising average global temperature on 
physical and biological systems, and the situation is worsening (see, for example, IPCC, 
2007 and Rosenzweig et al., 2008). There is a risk of breaching unpredictable tipping 
points, such as a rise in arctic temperatures precipitating a massive release of methane 
from permafrost zones. Melting permafrost could also threaten oil and gas extraction 
infrastructure and pipeline stability. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable 
to global warming, as they are more dependent on resource sectors such as agriculture 
and with poor infrastructure, often lack the financial resources and capacity to readily 
adapt to a changing climate. These potentially dramatic impacts have been described 
in detail by the IPCC and others, and are discussed further in Chapter 17.
The impact of global warming on the energy sector
As well as playing a leading role in causing global warming, the energy sector could 
itself be substantially affected by a change in the global climate. Worryingly, some 
sources of renewable energy — one of the main climate-change mitigation options — 
could be adversely affected. 10
Hydropower 
Hydropower  is  the  world’s  largest  renewable  source  of  electricity,  generating 
3 035 TWh in 2006, around 16% of total electricity. The unexploited potential is large, 
particularly in non-OECD countries. However, although hydropower is a key mitigation 
option, climate change may have an overall net negative impact on water resources 
and therefore affect its future generation potential (Kundzewicz et al., 2007). 
10.  In contrast, receding sea ice might enable more gas and oil to be extracted from beneath the Arctic 
Ocean, raising the consumption of fossil fuels and accelerating the melting of the ice and rise in sea levels.

Chapter 16 - Implications of the Reference Scenario for the global climate 403
16
Growing concerns about competition for water supply, as well as other environmental 
and social concerns, may constrain some project developments. Where climate-change 
impacts result in water scarcity, the need for adaptation may result in improved water-
use efficiency through metering and incremental pricing, increased withdrawal of water 
for irrigation and the trading of water rights. There could be some adverse effects on 
local hydropower plant operation and costs. Climate change is also likely to alter river 
discharge rates and hence water availability for in-stream uses, including hydropower, 
navigation, fisheries and recreation, as well as for out-of-stream demands, such as 
irrigation, municipal use, industrial use and cooling (Kundzewicz et al., 2007). 
The overall effect on hydropower production potential would be mixed: there could 
be an increase in some regions, for example, in Scandinavia and Russia, but a fall 
elsewhere, for example, in Portugal, Spain and Australia. In alpine areas, run-off may 
decrease  in  summer  and  increase  in  winter,  exacerbating  sedimentation  problems 
but perhaps also making the management of water storage easier. There may be less 
storage as snow and ice in winter, thereby adversely affecting river flows in summer 
and autumn. In Nepal, China and elsewhere, storage of water as ice in glaciers may 
decrease and seasonal discharge rates change. Hydrological regimes driven more by 
precipitation than by snow and glacier-melt processes could experience increased year-
to-year variability of mean annual discharges, thus adversely affecting the hydropower 
generation potential (Horton et al., 2005). 
Sudden discharge outbursts from lakes formed by rapidly melting glaciers have already 
created  surges  of  water  and  debris  sufficient  to  damage  hydropower  facilities  and 
threaten local communities. Some hydropower generators have already adjusted their 
production  forecasts  downwards  to  reflect  changing  precipitation  projections,  thus 
affecting the economics over the lifetime of a plant. 
Other renewable energy systems
In all the scenarios considered in this Outlook, increased deployment of other forms 
of renewable electricity, heating, cooling and transport fuels is projected. However, 
the prospect of climate change introduces uncertainties which could affect virtually all 
forms of renewable energy.
Wind  resource  intensity  and  duration  can  affect  turbine  capacity  factors  and   
extreme gales may damage turbines and shorten their working life.
Solar radiation levels are subject to reductions of up to 20% in some regions (Bull   
et al., 2007), due to increased cloud cover, and there is a risk of damage to solar 
collection  facilities  from  extreme  weather  conditions,  such  as  hail.  In  addition, 
higher ambient temperatures can reduce the output and life of photovoltaic cells.
Biomass may experience lower crop yields due to water shortages and increased   
warming, though higher atmospheric CO
2
 levels will increase crop and forest growth 
rates. There could be effects on biomass use for traditional cooking and heating 
purposes as well on biofuel production for transport fuels. Longer frost-free periods 
and  fewer  freezes  can  benefit  some  crops  more  than  others,  and  there  will  be 
regional  differences,  with  Africa  and  southern  Asia  more  likely  to  be  adversely 
affected than Russia (Lobell et al., 2008).

404 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Geothermal power generation will be less efficient if warmer water or air is used for   
cooling. This will also apply to thermal power plants.
Thermal and nuclear power 
For coal, gas, oil and nuclear power plants, the lower the temperature of the cooling 
system, the higher the plant efficiency. Higher average temperature of the cooling 
water taken from waterways, together with possibly reduced supply in dry periods, 
could result in lower power output: plant shutdowns are already being experienced 
under hot ambient air conditions. Greater investment in closed-cycle cooling systems is 
likely in some areas. Higher temperatures will also reduce the effectiveness of closed-
cycle cooling systems. Such power generation constraints could coincide with peak 
demand for air-conditioning, putting stress on the entire power-supply system. 
Concerns  about  the  future  availability  of  cooling  water,  when  in  competition  with 
drinking water and irrigation, may restrict power project developments. Other risks 
include surface erosion affecting open-cast mining of coal, disruptions to offshore oil 
and gas extraction platforms and refineries due to hurricanes, impacts on LNG and oil 
transport systems, and greater cost for gas and oil pipelines designed to pass through 
unstable regions with melting permafrost. Existing infrastructure may need replacing.
Local and regional air pollution
Rising energy consumption, increasing mobility and continuing reliance on fossil fuels 
are damaging ambient air quality in many developing countries. Emissions of SO
2
, NO
x
, 
CO and particulate matter (PM) are harmful to human health as well as being the cause 
of environmental problems, such as acid rain, reduced visibility and ground-level ozone 
formation, though they can also reduce the overall warming impact of greenhouse-gas 
emissions (see footnotes 5 and 8). 
Air pollution remains a major public health issue in cities across the developing world, 
notably in China and India, where ambient air quality continues to deteriorate (IEA, 
2007). In addition to the local consequences of unabated emissions, the effects of air 
pollution are felt beyond national borders. For example, when monsoon winds are 
prevalent, the citizens of Bangladesh and Pakistan suffer from pollutants generated in 
India. Likewise, the air quality in Pakistan and Bangladesh affects the citizens of India 
and other border countries.

East, are still rising. Emissions of particulate matter, on the other hand, exhibit a 
steady decline at the world level over the Outlook period. At 28 Mt in 2030, emissions 
will be about one-quarter lower than in 2005.

 and particulate matter from large combustion plants in power stations, petroleum 
refineries, steelworks and other industrial processes. Emissions caps have been set 
by the Large Combustion Plant Directive in the European Union and by the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR) in the eastern United States. Non-OECD countries, on the other 
hand, see their SO
2
 emissions increase at a rate of around 1% per year, from 61 Mt in 
2005 to 77 Mt in 2030. NO
x
 emissions also increase steadily in non-OECD countries over 
the projection period. 
In China, SO
2
 emissions in the power-generation sector stabilise around 2020, due to 
stricter regulation, but they continue to rise in the transport sector. Despite rapidly 
growing transport demand to 2030, the enforcement of vehicle-emission controls in 
China limits NO
x
 emissions growth in this sector. Less-rigorous controls in the power- 
generation and industry sectors, however, result in overall NO
x
 emissions growing by 1.7% 
per year on average over the Outlook period, to 21 Mt in 2030. Particulate emissions, 
mainly from burning biomass in the residential and agriculture sectors, decline in China 
by 1.6% per year over the Outlook period because of faster penetration of improved 
cooking stoves and stricter controls on industry, power plants and vehicles.
India currently lacks a comprehensive strategy to control SO
2
 emissions, which more 
than double over the Outlook period. As in China, the gradual introduction of vehicle- 
emission standards tempers the overall increase in NO
x
 emissions in India, but they still 
more than double, rising from 4 Mt in 2005 to 8 Mt in 2030, due to weaker regulation 
on industry and power plants. India’s NO
x
 emissions alone account for 5% of the world’s 
total in 2005, rising to 10% in 2030. Together, India and China account for over one-
third of global NO
x
 emissions in 2030. The decline in particulate-matter emissions is 
much slower in India, 0.6% per year in 2005-2030, than in China, 1.6% per year, because 
the use of biomass resources for cooking and heating and for agricultural production 
still accounts for about half of energy demand in these sectors in India in 2030.
The  Middle  East  is  also  expected  to  see  worsening  local  and  regional  air  pollution 
due to rapidly rising oil and gas use in the power sector and limited emission-control 
requirements. SO
2
 emissions are projected to increase by more than 40% from 2005 to 
2030, reaching 9 Mt in 2030. SO
2
-emission controls are not expected to be imposed on 
power plants in the Middle East until after 2020. NO
x
 emissions are also projected to 
rise rapidly, by 1.5% per year on average over the Outlook period.
Regulatory  programmes,  international  treaties  and  emissions-control  technologies 
already exist to tackle many local and regional air pollutants. Furthermore, actions in 
pursuit of air pollution, climate change and other goals are often mutually supportive: 
improving energy efficiency, for example, reduces fossil-fuel consumption, reduces 
air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions and benefits human health. Such policy 
integration, producing what are termed “co-benefits”, has been recognised by the IPCC 
and others as a promising approach in both developing and developed countries.
Industrialised  countries  provide  numerous  examples  of  how  air  quality  can  be 
improved despite growing energy consumption. The health benefits associated with 
more stringent environmental regulation and standards have often been found to 
outweigh the costs. For example, EPA claims that CAIR offers health benefits more 
than 25 times greater than the costs of the policy by 2015 (EPA, 2007).

Chapter 17 - The post-2012 climate policy framework  407
CHAPTER 17
THE POST-2012 CLIMATE POLICY 
FRAMEWORK
What role for energy in Copenhagen?
Strong, urgent action is needed to curb the growth in greenhouse-gas emissions   z
projected in the Reference Scenario and the resulting rise in global temperatures. A 
new post-2012 global climate-change policy regime — to be agreed in Copenhagen 
in late 2009 — aims to set a clear, quantified global goal for the stabilisation of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, ensuring broad participation and putting in 
place robust policy mechanisms to ensure the stated objective is achieved.
With energy-related CO  z 2  accounting for 61% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, 
the energy sector will be at the heart of discussions on a target for stabilising the 
concentration of greenhouse gases — and how to meet it. This Outlook considers 
two climate-policy scenarios: a 550 Policy Scenario, in which the concentration of 
greenhouse gases is stabilised at 550 parts per million of CO 2  equivalent, resulting 
in  a  temperature  rise  of  around  3°C;  and  a  450  Policy  Scenario,  in  which  the 
concentration is stabilised at 450 ppm CO 2 -eq, with a temperature rise of around 
2°C. 
Slow rates of capital-stock turnover, particularly in the power sector, mean that,   z
in  the  absence  of  disproportionate  expenditure,  plants  that  have  already  been 
built or are under construction — and their associated emissions — are effectively 
“locked-in”. This power-generation capacity accounts for over 75% of Reference 
Scenario  CO 2   emissions  in  2020.  This  limits  the  scope  for  the  sector  to  reduce 
emissions promptly without large-scale and very costly early retirement. Given this 
constraint and the time required to arrive at and implement a global agreement, we 
assume that, in the 450 Policy Scenario, the greenhouse-gas concentration initially 
overshoots the target level and then declines.
Five key regions — China, the United States, the European Union, India and Russia —   z
account for 65% of global energy-related CO 2  emissions. Achieving a 450 or 550 ppm 
CO 2 -eq trajectory requires that all major emitters cut their emissions substantially. 
This must include non-OECD countries, whose emissions in the Reference Scenario in 
2030 exceed the global emissions level of the 450 Policy Scenario.
There is a wide range of international policy mechanisms that could be adopted   z
to meet an agreed climate objective. Given countries’ varied circumstances and 
negotiating  positions,  they  are  likely  to  be  used  in  combination.  This  Outlook 
analyses the implications for the energy sector of a hybrid policy framework of cap-
and-trade, sectoral agreements, and national policies and measures.

408 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
In both climate scenarios, “OECD+” countries — a group that includes the OECD   z
and non-OECD EU countries — are assumed to take on national emissions-reduction 
targets and to participate in an international cap-and-trade system covering the 
power-generation  and  industry  sectors.  Other  Major  Economies  are  assumed  to 
implement national policies and measures in these sectors. These two groups are 
assumed to adopt sectoral agreements in the industry and transport sectors and 
national policies in the buildings sector. Other Countries are assumed to implement 
only  national  policies,  across  all  sectors,  but  can  generate  and  sell  emissions 
credits.
Co-ordinated global action to address climate 
change
The Reference Scenario trends in world energy use put the world on course for the 
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere to double from 380 parts 
per  million  in  2005  to  around  700  ppm  in  the  next  century.  Taking  into  account 
all  greenhouse  gases  in  all  sectors,  this  would  lead  to  a  CO 2 -equivalent  (CO 2 -eq) 
concentration  of  around  1  000  ppm,  corresponding  to  a  rise  in  global  average 
temperature  of  up  to  6°C,  relative  to  pre-industrial  levels.  Co-ordinated  action  is 
needed urgently to put the world on a different emissions trajectory. Following the 
publication of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, a new global consensus on 
the need for action has emerged. There is now widespread recognition that “warming 
of the climate system is unequivocal” and that “most of the global average warming 
over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases increases” 
(IPCC, 2007). Governments and industry alike are now incorporating climate-change 
considerations more seriously into their policies and business plans.
Progress has been made towards a global agreement and on implementing measures 
at the national and regional levels. The leaders of the G8 countries agreed in June 
2007 at Heiligendamm, to “consider seriously” the goal of halving global emissions 
by 2050. 1  In Hokkaido in 2008, the G8 went a step further, pledging to “consider and 
adopt” this goal in the forthcoming global climate-change negotiations. In late 2007, a 
meeting of nearly every world government, at the 13 th  Conference of the Parties (COP) 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), reached 
agreement on the “Bali Road Map”, a two-year process to improve implementation 
of the Convention through long-term, co-operative action, including commitments to 
mitigate climate change and actions to be taken beyond 2012 (the last year covered by 
commitments under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol). Negotiations will continue in December 
2008, at the 14 th  COP in Poznan, Poland. The road map is expected to be completed by
1.  Based on IPCC analysis, a reduction of this magnitude would be broadly consistent with stabilising the 
concentration of greenhouse gases at between 450 ppm and 500 ppm CO 2 -eq in the long term.

December 2009, at the 15 th  COP in Copenhagen, when key decisions will be taken on 
how the world will respond to the challenge of climate change. The UNFCCC process 
is  supplemented  by  other  high-profile  international  efforts,  including  the  US-led 
Major Economies Energy Security and Climate Change Initiative and the Asia-Pacific 
Partnership.
The  energy  sector  will  have  to  be  at  the  heart  of  discussions  on  what  level  of 
concentration  to  aim  for  and  how  to  achieve  it.  Energy-related  emissions  of  CO 2  
currently account for 61% of total greenhouse-gas emissions, a share that is projected 
to rise to 68% in 2030 in the Reference Scenario (see Chapter 16). For several years 
the World Energy Outlook has provided analysis of the implications of trends in the 
energy sector and the associated government policies for energy-related CO 2  emissions. 
This  year’s  Outlook  builds  on  this  analysis  and  breaks  new  ground  by  modelling 
the  implications  and  results  of  a  plausible  post-2012  international  climate-policy 
framework under two scenarios, one in which agreement is reached to stabilise the 
concentration of greenhouse gases at 550 ppm CO 2 -eq and another where the agreed 
stabilisation  level  is  450  ppm  CO 2 -eq.  We  do  not  focus  on  a  first-best,  theoretical 
world. Instead, we take account of the policy mechanisms currently under discussion, 
as  well  as  of  differences  in  countries’  circumstances  and  negotiating  positions,  to 
consider the implications of an indicative, but plausible, combination of international 
emissions caps, sectoral agreements and national policies and measures. The intention 
is not to forecast the political decision that will be taken in Copenhagen, but rather to 
inform the negotiations there by providing policy makers and the energy industry with 
a robust, quantified analysis of how the energy sector could respond to the need for 
deep emissions cuts. 2  
Agreeing on a global, post-2012 climate-policy regime is an enormous challenge. The 
defining issues to be resolved are:
What is the appropriate scale of ambition?  
What are the most efficient mechanisms for achieving the agreed objective?  
Which  country-by-country  commitments  and  actions  would  represent  a  fair  and   
equitable outcome?
There is a host of complications and subordinate issues. Setting the objective entails 
arriving  at  an  agreement  on  the  acceptable  level  at  which  the  concentration  of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is to be stabilised, the timescale over which that 
is to be achieved, and the associated path of emissions abatement. This means taking 
into account all the available evidence on the environmental, economic and social 
costs and benefits of action — and inaction. The timescales set must take account of 
the need for action over a long term, which depends on continuity and reasonable
2.  The analysis in this  Outlook beneﬁ ted from a high-level climate-change workshop in Copenhagen on 
17 April 2008. Details of this can be found at www.worldenergyoutlook.org/workshops.asp. Delegates ex-
pressed a wish that our analysis present a small number of realistic scenarios, focusing on the levels of 
stabilisation that are most relevant to international negotiations.

certainty, while yet allowing flexibility to adapt the framework according to lessons 
learned and changing circumstances and scientific knowledge. The equitable sharing of 
responsibilities will mean either wide acceptance of quantified emissions limitations or, 
at least, agreement on the range of actions to be undertaken by the respective groups 
of parties. What should the balance be between the available abatement measures, 
including  international  cap-and-trade  systems,  sectoral  agreements  and  discreet 
policies  and  measures,  whether  applied  internationally  or  nationally?    One  option 
is  a  graduated  approach,  whereby  countries  assume  responsibilities  progressively 
and at different times. There will need to be credible enforcement mechanisms and 
appropriate institutional arrangements.
There  is  no  correct  blueprint  for  the  outcome.  Judgements  will  inevitably  differ, 
according to broad environmental, financial, distributional and political considerations. 
With so many variables and so many countries involved, compromises must be reached 
and trade-offs negotiated.
Defining the long-term global climate objective
An international agreement on climate change needs to have at its core a clear long-
term goal of stabilising greenhouse-gas concentrations at an appropriate level and an 
emissions trajectory to achieve that goal in the most efficient and realistic way. Both 
elements will be decided collectively by negotiation. These decisions will be based 
on an appraisal of the costs and benefits of different stabilisation levels and how they 
might be achieved, taking full account of the practicalities. 
Environmental and societal effects of different stabilisation 
levels
There is no international consensus as yet on a long-term stabilisation or emissions 
objective, or on the emissions trajectory to its attainment. Nonetheless, international 
discussions are increasingly centred on a stabilisation level that ranges between 450 
and 550 ppm CO 2 -eq. According to the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, stabilisation 
at 450 ppm CO 2 -eq corresponds to a 50% chance of restricting the increase in global 
average temperature to around 2°C, while stabilisation at 550 ppm yields a rise of 
around 3°C (compared with 1 000 ppm and up to 6°C in the Reference Scenario). 3  
This  Outlook  analyses  the  implications  for  the  energy  sector  of  international  and 
national policy action to achieve these stabilisation levels in a 450 Policy Scenario and 
a 550 Policy Scenario (Box 17.1).
3.  Stabilisation levels of between 445 and 490 ppm CO 2 -eq (between 350 and 400 ppm CO 2 ) correspond to 
temperature rises of between 2.0° and 2.4°C. At 550 ppm CO 2 -eq, there would be a 24% probability of ex-
ceeding a 4°C temperature rise. The wide range reﬂ ects the uncertainty associated with different emission 
pathways and the sensitivity of climate to those emissions (IPCC, 2007).

Box 17.1 z  Discerning a stabilisation limit from the IPCC findings
The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report presents findings of analysis of the impact 
on the environment and society of different stabilisation levels and temperature 
increases (Figure 17.1). A 450 ppm CO 2 -eq stabilisation target would be extremely 
demanding, requiring emissions of greenhouse gases to peak within the next few 
years followed by annual reductions of 6% or more. 4  Average annual per-capita 
CO 2 -eq emissions would need to fall to around 2 tonnes by 2050, a significant 
drop from the current average of 7 tonnes (IPCC, 2007). Currently, emissions 
range from 26 tonnes per capita in the United States and Canada to 2 tonnes 
in South Asia. A 450 ppm target would require energy-related CO 2  emissions to 
fall by 50% to 85% below 2000 levels by 2050 to be consistent with the IPCC’s 
450 to 490 ppm CO 2 -eq range. According to the IPCC, even with stabilisation 
at 450 ppm CO 2 -eq (which is far below that implied by our Reference Scenario 
projections), the resulting change in global climate would lead to a significant 
rise in sea-level, species loss and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
A  550  ppm  CO 2 -eq  target  would  also  require  very  early  actions,  substantially 
greater  than  in  the  Reference  Scenario,  in  order  to  quickly  decelerate  the 
growth in annual emissions. To meet this target, CO 2  emissions would have to 
peak  —  and  decline  —  during  the  Outlook’s  projection  period.  The  next  few 
years are, therefore, crucially important. Any delay will result in an increased 
risk of a still higher temperature increase, which could give rise to irreversible 
change or demand even more costly and rapid emission-reduction rates later on.
Practical considerations in reducing emissions 
When choosing an appropriate global emissions trajectory, policy makers will need 
to  take  into  consideration  the  practical  implications  in  terms  of  technological 
requirements and costs, particularly in the energy sector. A stabilisation objective 
of  450  or  550  ppm  CO 2 -eq  would  pose  a  major  transformational  challenge  for  the 
sector, involving substantial additional investment over and above that needed in the 
Reference Scenario. 
The normal cycle of capital replacement is a key constraint on the speed with which 
low-carbon technologies can enter into use without incurring disproportionate cost. 
The  rate  of  capital  replacement  differs  substantially  by  industry  and  by  region, 
depending on the path of technological progress, costs, the policy environment and 
capital lifetimes. 5  The energy sector has a relatively slow rate of capital replacement 
in general, due to the long lifetime of much of its capital (see Chapter 1). As a result, 
4.  Some studies, such as Hansen et al. (2008), have even suggested that a 1°C temperature rise limit should 
be set if dangerous interference with the climate system is to be avoided. This would require an overall 
CO 2 -eq stabilisation level of 400 ppm, which would be substantially more challenging than even the most 
ambitious category of scenarios in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007). 
5.  See Lempert et al. (2002) for a discussion of the drivers of rates of capital replacement.

more efficient technologies normally take many years to spread through the energy 
sector.  It  will  be  necessary  to  face  up  to  the  reality  of  the  cost  of  early  capital 
retirement if radical measures are to be taken to speed up this process so as to deliver 
deep cuts in emissions.

The  rate  of  capital-stock  turnover  is  particularly  slow  in  the  power  sector,  where 
large up-front costs and long operating lifetimes mean that plants that have already 
been built — and their associated emissions — are effectively “locked-in”. This limits 
the scope for the sector to reduce emissions without large-scale and very costly early 
retirement. In the Reference Scenario, three-quarters of the emissions from electricity 
generation worldwide in 2020 (and more than half in 2030) comes from power stations 
that are already operating today (Figure 17.2). As a result, even if all power plants built 
from now onwards were carbon-free, CO 2  emissions from the power sector would still 
be only 25%, or 4 Gt, lower in 2020 relative to the Reference Scenario. 6

Note: Due to the timescales associated with planning and building new plants, all emissions up to 2012 are 
assumed to be locked-in.
Source: IEA analysis.
Technology lock-in is also a barrier to reducing emissions in the industrial sector. In the 
steel sector, where capital plant typically has a lifetime in excess of 25 years, around 
60% of all the plants in the world will be less than ten years old in 2010, leaving little 
scope for replacing them over the following decade with more efficient ones. The 
picture is similar in the cement industry (see Chapter 18). In industry as a whole, the 
potential for emissions cuts without early retirement is in line with what is required 
in  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  but  falls  far  short  of  what  is  needed  in  the  450  Policy 
Scenario. 
Climate scenarios modelled in 
WEO-2008
Our choice of climate scenarios for this year’s Outlook — corresponding to stabilisation 
of  greenhouse-gas  concentration  at  450  and  550  ppm  CO 2 -eq  —  reflects  both  the 
current  state  of  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  environmental  and  societal

impacts of climate change, as well as the costs and practicalities of reducing emissions 
in  the  energy  sector.  For  each  scenario,  we  have  calculated  both  a  trajectory  for 
the concentration of greenhouse gases in total (Figure 17.3) and an energy-related 
CO 2   emissions  trajectory  to  2030  that  is  consistent  with  these  stabilisation  levels 
(Figure 17.4).

Note: We used MAGICC (Version 5.3) 7  to confirm that the projected emissions for all greenhouse gases to 
2030 would result in concentration trajectories consistent with achieving stabilisation at around 700 ppm 
CO 2  (equivalent to around 1 000 ppm CO 2 -eq) in the Reference Scenario, at 450 ppm CO 2  (550 CO 2 -eq) in the 
550 Policy Scenario and 380 ppm CO 2  (450 ppm CO 2 -eq) in the 450 Policy Scenario.
Because of technology lock-in and in view of the time needed to agree and implement 
a global post-2012 framework and of the scale of effort that would be required in OECD 
and non-OECD countries alike, the 450 Policy Scenario follows a trajectory to 2020 
that overshoots the ultimate objective, 8  with greenhouse-gas concentration initially 
rising above 450 ppm CO 2 -eq, but then declining. A 450 stabilisation trajectory without 
overshoot would need to achieve substantially lower emissions in the period up to 2020 
and, realistically, this could be done only by scrapping very substantial amounts of 
existing capital across all energy-related industries. 9  In any case, given the scale of new 
investment required, it is unlikely that the necessary new equipment and infrastructure 
could be built and deployed quickly enough to meet demand.
7.  MAGICC is a Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change, created by Professor 
Tom Wigley (www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/).
8.  In an overshoot trajectory, concentrations of greenhouse gases peak above the stabilisation target, but 
subsequently decline. A substantial overshoot, or the overshoot of a high stabilisation level, would entail 
major risks and could inﬂ uence transient temperature, whereas a limited overshoot of a lower stabilisation 
level should not, given the inertia of the climate system.
9.  To achieve a CO 2 -eq stabilisation level of 450 ppm without overshooting, the energy sector would need 
to deliver CO 2  reduction of more than 9 Gt in 2020, relative to the Reference Scenario. Taking into account 
lock-in in the power and industry sectors, this would require 60% emission reduction from the transport and 
buildings sectors, on top of fully exploiting the scope for action in both power and industry.

Note: The ranges are taken from published scenarios, some of which include industry CO 2  emissions whereas 
others only include energy-related CO 2  (Nakicenovic, 2007). The 550 Policy Scenario is compared to the 
IPCC’s Class III of scenarios (440-485 ppm CO 2 ; 535-590 ppm CO 2 -eq; ~3°C temperature rise); the 450 Policy 
Scenario  is  compared  to  the  IPCC’s  Class  I  of  scenarios  (350-400  ppm  CO 2 ;  445-490  ppm  CO 2 -eq;  ~2°C 
temperature rise). The WEO’s CO 2  pathways are also consistent with the analysis of non-energy CO 2  and other 
greenhouse gases discussed in Chapter 18.
CO 2  emissions in the 550 Policy Scenario level out around 2020, before falling sharply 
from  2030.  Emissions  in  the  450  Policy  Scenario  follow  the  550  Policy  Scenario 
trajectory until around 2020 and then begin a sharp, sustained decline. To achieve 
this much more stringent abatement after 2020, the 450 Policy Scenario requires 
substantial  additional  policy  effort  and  technological  progress  before  that  date. 
For both the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios, the trajectory lies within the range of 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
416 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
the various scenarios developed by other bodies and evaluated by the IPCC for the 
Fourth Assessment Report. The 450 Policy Scenario is near the upper limit of the 
corresponding  range  of  IPCC  scenarios,  reflecting  our  overshooting  assumption. 
Nonetheless, due to differences in the underlying assumptions, comparisons of our 
CO 2 -emission trajectories with those of other studies, using different models, can be 
only indicative. 
Although our analysis focuses on the impact of policy actions in the energy sector 
between today and 2030, emission reductions, in both scenarios, need to continue after 
2030 on an even larger scale. The IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives: Scenarios and 
Strategies to 2050 report provides a longer term perspective on technological solutions 
and the roadmaps for delivering them (IEA, 2008a). Substantial emissions reductions 
are also needed in non-energy sectors. Both the 550 and 450 Policy Scenarios imply 
that net greenhouse-gas emissions turn negative — i.e. carbon absorption exceeds gross 
emissions — towards the end of this century. 10  
Whatever the overall objective that is adopted, the challenge is huge: both of our 
scenarios imply very substantial greenhouse-gas emissions reductions compared with 
the Reference Scenario and require that energy-related CO 2  emissions peak around 
2020. In both cases, a major transformation of the energy system takes place, requiring 
large-scale investment in low-carbon technology development and deployment (see 
Chapter 19).
Participation
The scale of action needed in both the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios means that a post-
2012 climate-policy framework needs to promote abatement in all countries. Yet it is 
clear that any agreement will need to take into account the importance of a handful 
of major emitters. The five largest emitters of energy-related CO 2  (China, the United 
States, the European Union, India and Russia) together account for almost two-thirds 
of  global  CO 2   emissions;  in  the  Reference  Scenario,  this  proportion  is  expected  to 
remain similar in 2020 (Table 17.1). The contributions to emissions reduction made by 
China and the United States will be critical to reaching the stabilisation goal in both 
scenarios. While the United States has historically been the highest emitter of energy-
related CO 2 , China overtook it in 2007 and per-capita emissions in China are now above 
the world average. Neither country has a quantified national emissions commitment 
under the Kyoto Protocol. The participation in appropriate ways of non-OECD countries 
will be indispensable: by 2020, they account for 62% of global CO 2  emissions in the 
Reference Scenario. 
10.  In theory, this could be achieved by carbon sequestration, either through afforestation and refores-
tation, by the production of bio-char as part of the biomass energy conversion process which can then be 
integrated into the soil or by carbon capture and storage technologies applied to the combustion of biomass 
for heat and power generation or hydrogen production.

The  scale  of  the  reduction  in  energy-related  emissions  by  country  grouping  varies 
markedly with different levels of international participation (Figure 17.5). Were the 
OECD alone to take on all the burden of reducing emissions, the OECD countries would 
need to achieve reductions of almost 27% by 2020, vis-à-vis the Reference Scenario. In 
fact, achieving the 450 ppm emissions trajectory thereafter without the participation 
of non-OECD countries would not be possible (see Spotlight below). In both the 450 
and 550 Policy Scenarios, even after allowing for international emissions trading and 
the active engagement of non-OECD countries, OECD countries would have to make 
very  substantial  emissions  reductions  domestically,  such  is  the  scale  of  the  global 
challenge.

418 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Why is it an absolute “must” for non-OECD countries to play 
their part in a global climate-change regime?
Over half of today’s global energy-related CO 2  emissions are from non-OECD 
countries, a share that is rising rapidly. In the Reference Scenario, 97% of the 
increase in emissions between 2006 and 2030 occurs in non-OECD countries. In 
China alone, in every year between 2007 and 2030, energy-related CO 2  emissions 
rise on average by more than the total increase, over the whole period, of all 
OECD countries.
Achieving  the  global  emissions  reductions  required  to  limit  greenhouse-gas 
concentration  to  550  ppm  CO 2 -eq  without  the  participation  of  non-OECD 
countries  would  be  extremely  challenging,  to  say  the  least.  The  global 
abatement needed in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario equates to 58% of OECD 
Reference Scenario emissions (Figure 17.6). For the OECD alone to take on all of 
this burden would pose huge practical difficulties, entail substantial scrapping 
of capital and be highly inefficient since abatement costs would be much lower 
in non-OECD countries.
The message from the 450 Policy Scenario is clear: it is simply not possible to 
lower concentration to 450 ppm CO 2 -eq without the participation of non-OECD 
countries. In 2030, non-OECD emissions in the Reference Scenario exceed global 
emissions  in  the  450  Policy  Scenario.  In  other  words,  if  non-OECD  countries 
do not reduce their emissions relative to the Reference Scenario, a 450 ppm 
trajectory could not be achieved, even if OECD countries reduce their emissions 
to zero.

Principles for allocating responsibilities
The allocation of national responsibilities for emissions reduction is a fundamental 
issue in negotiations on a global climate agreement. Although it is often discussed 
in  the  context  of  cap-and–trade  arrangements,  it  is  equally  relevant  to  sectoral 
approaches and to a formalised system of national policies and measures. Reaching a 
global agreement on allocations is particularly challenging, as there are many different 
views on how the appropriate allocation of responsibilities can be gauged and what 
would represent a “fair” outcome (Box 17.2). We make no suggestion here as to which 
allocation or method of allocation is most appropriate — this is entirely a matter for 
negotiation. 
Box 17.2 z  Principles for differentiating responsibilities*
Some of the most discussed principles for the possible allocation of responsibilities 
between countries or groups of countries are the following:
Current or historic emissions level:  z  Requiring that current or recent emissions 
be the benchmark from which all countries achieve reductions.
Cumulative emissions:   z Holding countries responsible for their total contribution 
to climate change, including those emissions made in the past. This model rose 
to prominence with the Brazilian proposal (BMST, 2000) during the original 
Kyoto Protocol negotiations.
Population:  z  Aiming to equalise global per-capita emissions allowances by a 
given date.
GDP per capita:   z Recognising ability to pay for climate-change mitigation. In 
Kyoto, binding targets were only applied to the world’s richer nations. 
Emissions per unit of GDP:  z  Recognising the “necessary” pollution that comes 
with a high level of output.
Reduction potential:   z Reflecting differing scope for reducing emissions (this 
will typically involve sectoral bottom-up analyses, taking into account factors 
such as economic structure and fuel mix).
Costs  or  benefits  of  reduction:  z   Reflecting  different  national  endowments, 
mitigation costs and potential to benefit from abatement.
Building  on  existing  national  groupings:  z   Basing  responsibilities  on,  for 
example, OECD/non-OECD or UNFCCC groupings.
* For a more detailed discussion, see Höhne et al. (2003) and Bodansky (2004).
Discussion of the relative merits of the different mechanisms for reducing emissions 
— including cap-and-trade, sectoral agreements and national policies — can become 
clouded by the misconception that the choice of mechanism will determine the scale 
of the abatement each country faces. However, this choice does not affect allocation,

nor who pays for the abatement; a wide range of allocations is possible, regardless 
of the mechanisms adopted. Rather, it is the different principles for determining a 
“fair” allocation of responsibilities that yield very different national outcomes. Table 
17.2 demonstrates, for illustrative purposes, the outcomes of applying four different 
principles under a global system of national emissions allowances, in order to achieve 
in 2020 a 10% reduction relative to the Reference Scenario in world energy-related CO 2  
emissions. If national emissions reductions were determined on the basis of endowments 
allocated  equally  per  head  of  population,  the  total  allocation  for  many  non-OECD 
countries would be substantially higher than their current and projected emissions 
under the Reference Scenario. 11  This would give them scope for generating income 
through trading their surplus, and scope to profit from any further reductions they 
achieve relative to the Reference Scenario. On the other hand, allocations based on 
GDP or current (or recent) emissions result in a lower figure for the required emissions 
reductions in OECD countries. Irrespective of the principles applied, additional financial 
transfers, which may form part of a post-2012 agreement, could potentially be made to 
adjust for any residual “unfairness” in the initial emissions allocation.

Policy mechanisms
Sharp  reductions  in  global  emissions  will  not  be  achieved  without  a  structured 
agreement  on  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  framework  of  effective 
international  policy  mechanisms.  Options  for  such  a  framework  abound  in  the 
economic, political and environmental literature. In international discussions, many 
OECD  countries  are  currently  considering  a  system  of  national  emissions  caps  with 
trading of emissions credits among countries — including some non-OECD countries. 
Theory suggests that an approach such as this, or a global carbon tax, both of which 
place an international price on carbon, potentially offer the lowest-cost solution in 
economic terms. 12  However, it is politically and practically very difficult to determine 
a fair and equitable initial allocation of emission quotas. 
Non-OECD countries have generally avoided overt consideration of emissions caps for 
fear that such caps would restrict their economic development. However, many of 
them would be prepared to consider a more formalised system of national policies 
and  measures  aimed  at  specified  emission  reductions,  if  accompanied  by  support 
from  developed  countries  through  technology  transfer,  financial  support  or  other 
measures. There is also growing interest in international sectoral approaches (involving 
agreements on national commitments to deploy common processes or adopt common 
standards  such  as  intensity  targets  to  reduce  emissions  in  specific  sectors).  These 
could operate on a stand-alone basis for some groups of countries or sectors, or as a 
complement to a system of national emissions caps. 
In principle, any one of these elements could alone be the basis of a post-2012 regime. 
However, as current political debate shows, and given practical issues in the energy 
sector, the reality is that nations adopt the approach or approaches that best reflect 
their varied interests and capabilities. Thus, an effective future regime is likely to 
involve a combination of policy mechanisms, tailored to particular needs but also, 
hopefully,  interlinked,  in  order  to  achieve  maximum  economic  efficiency. 13   Our 
analysis focuses on the three main approaches set out above, namely international cap-
and-trade systems, sectoral agreements and enhanced national policies and measures. 
Alongside these approaches, technology transfer and financial assistance can be used 
to contribute to efficiency and fairness. 
In the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios, all three approaches are assumed to be adopted 
in a hybrid way, with their combination tailored according to the circumstances and 
political  realities  in  different  countries/regions  and  sectors  (Figure  17.7).  The  mix 
is more or less the same in both scenarios and takes into account current national 
12.  For  example,  IMF  (2008)  notes  that  “market-based  policies  have  an  important  advantage  over 
performance standards”.
13.  These elements should not be considered as static choices. An international regime can and should 
evolve over time in order to build on lessons learned and to reﬂ ect changing environmental and natio-
nal circumstances. They can also form part of a graduated approach, whereby countries assume greater 
responsibilities over time.

Notes:  OECD+  includes  all  OECD  countries,  as  well  as  those  EU  countries  that  are  not  members  of  the 
OECD. The Other Major Economies group contains the largest emitters outside OECD+ (based on their total 
emissions of energy-related CO 2  in 2006): China, Russia, India, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil and 
South Africa. For modelling purposes, we include the entire Middle East region and exclude South Africa. 
In the 450 Policy Scenario, Other Major Economies are assumed to participate in the cap-and-trade system 
in power generation and industry from 2020 onwards.
OECD  countries  and  countries  that  are  members  of  the  European  Union  but  not 
the OECD — “OECD+” — are assumed to introduce binding economy-wide emissions 
targets,  with  a  cap-and-trade  system  covering  the  power-generation  and  industry 
sectors. “Other Major Economies” — other major non-OECD+ economies — and “Other 
Countries” would have the opportunity to generate and trade emissions credits, but 
they are not assumed to face binding emissions caps. Rather, they undertake to adopt 
national  policies  and  measures  in  the  power-generation  and  industry  sectors.  To 
reflect concerns about carbon leakage and competitiveness in the industry sector, we 
have assumed that international sectoral agreements covering the OECD+ and Other 
Major  Economies  groups  are  adopted  with  respect  to  iron  and  steel  and  cement, 14  
as a complement to cap-and-trade and national policies in those industries. In the 
transport sector, we have assumed that sectoral agreements are applied across the 
OECD+ and Other Major Economies, while national policies and measures apply in Other 
Countries. In the buildings sector, all countries are assumed to adopt only national 
14.   The power sector is not covered by a formal sectoral approach in the scenarios, though countries 
may, in reality, decide to pursue other forms of collaboration in this sector in order to facilitate technology 
transfer.

policies and measures. Other Countries are assumed to undertake across all sectors 
only national policies and measures and to do so only where this is compatible with 
their development objectives. 15  The same mix of approaches in each country/region 
is assumed in the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios with one exception: the Other Major 
Economies group is assumed to participate in the cap-and-trade regime from 2020 in 
the 450 Policy Scenario.
Cap-and-trade systems
The  majority  of  proposed  post-2012  regimes  for  emissions  abatement  are 
underpinned  by  caps  on  the  quantity  of  emissions  in  participating  countries.  A 
major  advantage  of  such  caps  is  that  they  offer  a  high  degree  of  certainty  of 
meeting an emissions goal — a crucial factor given the climate risks associated with 
exceeding a global target trajectory. The drawback is that they impose uncertain 
costs on the economy. 
The most straightforward form of a quantity-based approach is a series of absolute, 
fixed  country  emissions  limits.  This  is  the  principal  feature  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol: 
industrialised  nations  agreed  to  binding  targets  for  greenhouse-gas  emissions  over 
the period 2008-2012, involving on average a 5.2% reduction relative to 1990 levels. 
The  Bali  Action  Plan  states  explicitly  that  the  UNFCCC  process  of  negotiating  an 
international agreement on climate change for the period beyond 2012 should consider 
“quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives” by all developed country 
Parties (UNFCCC, 2007).
With  a  set  of  emissions  caps,  markets  can  be  established  to  allow  trading  of 
emissions  credits  to  take  place,  which,  in  principle,  can  enhance  the  overall 
economic  efficiency  and  lower  the  global  cost  of  reducing  emissions.  These 
transactions  set  a  price  on  emissions,  expressed  in  terms  of  or  limited  to  CO 2 , 
allowing the market to select areas for emissions reduction along the energy chain 
and in other parts of the economy. Depending on the regime, trading may take 
place  between  countries  or  companies,  or  both.  To  achieve  the  most  efficient 
outcome, emissions caps must apply to each source of emissions, in order to allow 
full trading. For practical reasons, this normally means at the level of companies 
above  a  certain  size.  The  EU  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  provides  for  trading 
between all the companies covered (the largest emitters in industry and the power 
sector) across all EU countries. Under the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised countries 
are allowed to trade credits, while the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows 
these countries to obtain credits from non-OECD countries in return for undertaking 
low-carbon investments.
15.   While the scenarios assume that Other Countries are not required to play a part in cap-and-trade 
or sectoral approaches, they could still be given ﬁ nancial and technological incentives to achieve quan-
tiﬁ ed  emissions  reduction  or  sectoral  standards.  One  way  this  could  be  achieved  is  through  a  crediting 
mechanism for a number of sectors to enable these countries to receive funds from OECD+ countries in return for 
undertaking abatement activities — an enhanced version of the existing Clean Development Mechanism.

424 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Emissions-trading systems in OECD countries 
Cap-and-trade systems are already becoming widespread across OECD countries. In 
addition to the EU scheme, several countries have established their own emissions-
trading systems or have announced such schemes for the future (Table 17.3). A global 
post-2012 framework could seek to expand the international carbon market in order to 
allow trading between these different systems.
Although national emissions caps can encompass all sectors, emissions trading at the 
company level is more viable in some sectors than others. With the exception of New 
Zealand,  which  intends  to  adopt  a  comprehensive,  economy-wide  approach,  most 
planned  and  existing  systems  focus  on  a  small  number  of  major  emitting  sectors. 
Typically,  these  include  the  power-generation  sector  and  heavy  industry,  which 
account for a large share of total greenhouse-gas emissions and whose emissions can 
be relatively easily attributed to individual companies. Moreover, emitting companies 
in these sectors tend to be large, greatly reducing the cost per unit of emissions of 
compliance, monitoring and trading. 16  It is, however, possible for more diffuse sources 
of energy-related CO 2  emissions, such as road transport, also to be covered by upstream 
cap-and-trade systems: in this case, fuel producers, rather than end users, participate 
in emissions trading.
In areas such as agriculture, land use and buildings, emissions are very difficult to 
monitor and attribute, so these sectors do not lend themselves readily to emissions 
trading at the company level. Consequently, any post-2012 cap-and-trade system would 
be unlikely to cover emissions from all sectors. 17  However, as such a system evolved 
and if monitoring improved, additional sectors could subsequently be added. 18  
Emissions-trading systems in non-OECD countries
Most  non-OECD  countries  do  not  have  any  formal  quantified  commitment  under 
the  Kyoto  Protocol  to  limit  their  greenhouse-gas  emissions.  Cap-and-trade  systems 
require substantial administrative capacity to monitor, verify and enforce emissions 
objectives — usually not available in these countries. Were non-OECD countries to seek 
to advance down this route, they would first need to build national and sector-based 
emissions inventories and then create credible trading rules and means of enforcing 
them. Subsidies are another obstacle to the effectiveness of emissions-trading systems 
in non-OECD countries, as they dampen price signals. 
In  the  longer  term,  there  would  be  undoubted  benefits  from  including  the  largest 
non-OECD emitters, such as China and India, in an international cap-and-trade system. 
Their  inclusion  would  offer  greater  global  certainty  about  the  long-term  global 
16.  Most existing schemes include a minimum threshold for participation, such as the thermal capacity of 
installations.
17.  They could, however, be included in a country’s emissions cap.
18.  This evolutionary expansion of emissions-trading schemes is the approach being taken by the European 
Union, which is considering the addition of aviation, and New Zealand, which aims to eventually include all 
its emissions, including the majority that arise from agriculture.

emissions trajectory and meeting the ultimate stabilisation goal, reducing the risk of 
industrialised countries “exporting” emissions by relocating their industries outside the 
cap-and-trade zone. 
If non-OECD countries were included in a cap-and-trade system, it would be important 
to  ensure  that  their  participation  was  on  terms  consistent  with  their  meeting 
development objectives. There are a number of ways this could be achieved, including 
through  generous  emissions  allocation,  a  comprehensive  package  of  financial  and 
technological support, or a graduated approach that sets caps only for countries above 
a threshold level of development. Another option is to set non-binding targets for non-
OECD countries (Box 17.3).
Box 17.3 z  Non-binding targets for non-OECD countries?
A  possible  barrier  to  the  adoption  of  binding  emission  targets  by  non-OECD 
countries is the uncertainty over the total cost that would be incurred to meet 
them. This uncertainty reflects the difficulty of predicting the pace and extent of 
their future economic growth, and the associated emissions and the cost of efforts 
to curb them. So-called non-binding targets offer a possible solution: a country 
with emissions below its target could sell the difference on the international 
carbon market. It would not, however, be obliged to buy emissions if they were 
above  the  target  (Philibert,  2000).  With  appropriate  domestic  policies,  such 
non-binding targets could only be beneficial to the country concerned. Hence, 
they are sometimes called “no-lose” targets. They could be applied nation- or 
sector-wide. 
A  country  adopting  a  non-binding  target  could  undertake  specific  mitigation 
measures  towards  the  goal  and,  after  verification,  sell  excess  allowances  to 
generate  revenue.  Frequent  compliance  checks  would  deliver  these  financial 
benefits  more quickly. If selling were to be allowed before compliance  were 
established, a country having sold more allowances than the difference between 
the target and its actual emissions would be required to buy allowances to cover 
the excess sales. Investors in mitigation would need some such guarantee that 
their emissions reductions could be sold, even if other developments took the 
country’s total emissions above the specified limit.
Sectoral agreements
Arrangements to curb emissions from a particular sector of the economy can potentially 
make an important contribution to the global emissions-reduction objective. In this 
Outlook,  the  term  “sectoral  agreement”  is  defined  as  an  international  agreement 
that commits participating countries to adopting common processes or objectives in 
order to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from a specific sector. One example is an 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
428 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
agreement to reduce energy intensity in the steel sector by a specified amount over a 
set period. Action at the sectoral level is sometimes referred to under the broader term 
of “sectoral approaches”. 19
Some  countries  may  implement  sectoral  agreements  as  a  stand-alone  means  of 
achieving abatement. For certain sectors or countries, sectoral agreements may offer 
lower transaction costs or be easier to negotiate than emissions caps. In the European 
Union, sectoral policy approaches (such as vehicle-emission standards) are increasingly 
being deployed to stimulate sectors not yet fully covered by emissions targets. Since 
sectoral agreements are seen by some as less onerous than cap-and-trade systems, 
they may pave the way for non-OECD countries to participate in a global framework in 
a manner consistent with their economic development priorities (Baron et al., 2007). 
They could provide a stepping stone towards later participation in a global cap-and-
trade system. Sectoral agreements could also operate as a complement to cap-and-
trade, 20  during the time it takes for that mechanism to bed down, or in order to address 
concerns over carbon leakage and competitiveness (Box 17.4).
Sectoral agreements could take various forms, the most prominent being intensity or 
efficiency targets. Depending on the sector, there could be a unit efficiency target 
for  specific  items  of  equipment  or  appliances  (which  could  be  met,  for  example, 
through standards) or an average efficiency target for the energy inputs to that sector 
(for example, a country’s power sector could be required to meet a goal in terms of 
tonnes of CO 2  per megawatt hour generated). In the European Union, average carbon 
efficiency targets have been proposed for vehicle manufacturers, in order to reduce 
the CO 2  emissions of the average new car sold to 130 grammes per kilometre by 2012, 
from an average of 158 g in 2007. Another option is to mandate the use of certain 
technologies, as in the case of the European Union’s biofuels mandate and renewable 
fuels obligation. Future possible mandates could specify, for example, that coal power 
stations must have carbon capture and storage, or that solar panels must be installed. 
Another option would be to prohibit technologies or practices that are heavily polluting, 
such as gas flaring or urban use of sports utility vehicles.
There are many ways of setting targets. They could be developed by reference to 
existing best practice, by assuming a given rate of technological progress and capital- 
stock turnover, or by reference to a country’s existing level of energy efficiency or 
carbon per unit of output in given sectors. Japan has suggested identifying the leading 
existing technologies in key sectors, analysing sectoral emissions-reduction potential, 
and encouraging countries to set sectoral targets and use sectoral indicators, taking 
into account their national circumstances. Other approaches are focused on making
19.  In addition to sectoral agreements, there are many opportunities for using sector-level insights and 
initiatives in building a post-2012 climate framework. These include bottom-up approaches to calculating 
national emissions caps, sharing of knowledge or technology on a sector-by-sector basis, and sector-level 
accreditation of countries’ policies and emissions reductions.
20.  For example, the European Union’s Renewables Directive, a form of sectoral approach, operates as a 
complement to the EU Emission Trading Scheme.

Box 17.4 z  Carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness
The impact of climate policies on a country’s economic competitiveness and the 
potential for carbon leakage — the relocation of emissions to regions made more 
competitive as a result of others adopting policies to reduce CO 2  emissions — 
are potential barriers to reaching a new agreement on climate change. 21  These 
issues normally relate to participation under cap-and-trade, but may also arise 
in connection with other approaches. Penalties on carbon emissions within the 
constrained region create incentives for affected industries, especially the most 
energy intensive, either to source carbon-intensive inputs from an unconstrained, 
region or to relocate completely. As a result, constrained countries risk losing 
market share to unconstrained, competing countries. Furthermore, while one 
country  may  be  seen  to  be  reducing  emissions,  these  may  just  be  relocated 
elsewhere.  Global  emissions  may  even  increase  if  the  relocated  production 
facility uses more carbon-intensive technology. Thus, carbon leakage undermines 
the effectiveness of climate measures and penalises those countries that take the 
lead in combatting climate change. These concerns argue in favour of working 
towards a global cap-and-trade regime that is as inclusive as possible: the more 
countries that participate under the same constraints, the less the scope for 
carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness. 
International sectoral agreements provide a way of addressing these concerns, 
as  they  commit  countries  outside  the  cap-and-trade  area  to  meeting  similar 
standards  of  energy  or  CO 2   performance  per  unit  of  output.  Other  possible 
solutions  include  the  free  allocation  of  emissions  allowances  to  affected 
industries and border-price adjustment mechanisms, under which importers pay 
a tax equivalent to the carbon price within the constrained area.
Nonetheless,  even  in  the  absence  of  such  policies,  analysis  suggests  that  any 
negative impact on competitiveness and emissions abatement may be small. 22  There 
are many barriers to industrial relocation, at least in the short term, including the 
risk and cost associated with physically moving productive assets. Transportation 
costs,  existing  import  restrictions  and  capacity  constraints  are  also  limiting 
factors. 23  Moreover, a relatively small proportion of industrialised countries’ GDP 
comes from commodities with significant implied carbon costs (either from direct 
emissions or from electricity inputs). In the European Union, only 1% of GDP is 
derived from traded commodities where the implied carbon cost amounts to over 
4% of that commodity’s value added (Hourcade et al., 2007). There is still relatively 
little analysis of carbon leakage, although this situation should improve as new 
data becomes available from current and future trading regimes.
21.  See Reinaud (2008) for a detailed discussion of competitiveness and leakage issues.
22.  For example, CICERO (2007) modelling estimates that carbon leakage would be under 3% for the Kyoto 
regime as a whole and concludes that, if these ﬁ gures were accurate, “the problem is not critical with res-
pect to environmental effectiveness – or competitiveness effects.”
23.  The signiﬁ cance of these factors is highlighted by large price differences across regions. Analysis by BNP 
Paribas shows that cement prices vary greatly from one region to the next (from as low as $20 per tonne in 
some countries to over $110 per tonne in others).

incremental improvements from each country’s starting point. 24  A key challenge will 
be to ensure that sectoral approaches eventually move towards a full reflection of the 
carbon price that is faced by other sectors. 25
Sectoral  agreements  of  the  type  modelled  in  this  Outlook  are  not  appropriate  for 
all  sectors. They  are  best  suited  to  sectors  that  account  for  a  significant  share  of 
emissions, that have a high concentration of participants (thus limiting transaction 
costs) and that are exposed to global competition. Processes and products must also 
be reasonably uniform, if common standards are to be set. Sectoral agreements can 
only be used where it is feasible to measure energy efficiency or emissions. Figure 17.8 
shows how different sectors compare against some of these criteria. Those circled in 
the top right corner are likely to be the most appropriate for sectoral agreements as 
the number of participants is limited and the products are internationally traded and 
are relatively uniform. For example, the manufacture of large commercial aeroplanes 
is dominated by two companies — Boeing and Airbus — and their products are sold 
around the world. Aluminium, steel and motor-vehicle manufacturing are other good 
candidates. In contrast, sectors such as chemicals and buildings encompass a diverse 
range  of  products  and  processes,  while  agriculture  is  characterised  by  small-scale, 
diverse emitters.

24. A combination of these two principles is possible. Modelling of a “differentiated convergence triptych” 
(den Elzen et al., 2007) shows the world converging towards the efﬁ ciency levels of the current best country 
in each sector.
25.  When adopting a sector-by-sector approach, there is a risk of making fragmented decisions that do not 
reﬂ ect the relative costs of abatement across the global economy and, therefore, result in inefﬁ ciency. 
In the end, all sources should face the same cost of carbon to reach a least-cost allocation of reduction 
efforts.

Sectoral approaches already exist in a number of sectors. The Asia-Pacific Partnership 
on Clean Development and Climate is an intergovernmental public-private initiative to 
share information and best practice in eight sectors 26  among its partners — Australia, 
Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea and the United States — which together account 
for over 50% of both the world population and world energy use. Industry-led sectoral 
initiatives,  such  as  the  Cement  Sustainability  Initiative,  and  the  initiatives  of  the 
International Aluminium Institute and the International Iron and Steel Institute, have 
all made important progress on emissions measurement, one of the major challenges 
associated  with  the  implementation  of  sectoral  agreements  within  a  post-2012 
framework.
The 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios incorporate sectoral agreements in the transport 
sector  across  OECD+  and  Other  Major  Economies.  In  response  to  some  countries’ 
concerns  about  carbon  leakage  and  international  competitiveness,  we  have  also 
assumed that sectoral agreements for iron and steel and cement are adopted in these 
same  regional  groups  (overlapping  with  cap-and-trade  in  OECD+).  Although  a  good 
candidate for a sectoral agreement, the aluminium sector is not covered for lack of 
good  data.  A  sectoral  agreement  has  not  been  modelled  for  the  power-generation 
sector (Box 17.5).
Box 17.5 z  Sectoral approaches and the power-generation sector
The power sector is more fragmented and less engaged in international trade 
than  sectors  such  as  cement  and  steel.  It  is  accordingly  less  amenable  to  a 
quantified  sectoral  agreement  of  the  kind  assumed  in  our  climate  scenarios. 
Nonetheless, there is significant potential for other forms of sectoral approach in 
the power-generation sector. These could include: 
Initiatives to share knowledge.  z
Joint research, development and demonstration programmes.   z
Technology-transfer agreements.  z
While  national  circumstances  and  energy-security  concerns  will  continue  to 
play a key role in determining the evolution of the power sector, such forms of 
collaboration could be important in ensuring that all countries have access to 
the most efficient technologies, which in turn could lead to significant fuel and 
CO 2  savings. A recent IEA study estimates a technical CO 2 -reduction potential 
of around 2.5 Gt per year from improving the efficiency of fossil-fuelled power 
generation (IEA, 2008b).

432 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
National policies and measures
Cap-and-trade and sectoral agreements are unlikely to cover all sectors in all regions. 
However, regardless of the long-term climate goal that is set, it is important that 
emissions of greenhouse gases from all potential sources are abated. National policies 
and measures, tailored to local circumstances and markets, can cover all aspects of 
energy and carbon efficiency. In both the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios, we assume that 
only national policies are adopted in the buildings sector in all three regional groupings. 
This  is  because  the  sector  is  characterised  by  a  large  number  of  small  emitters, 
heterogenous products and processes, and large regional differences. The Other Major 
Economies are assumed to adopt national policies and measures in power generation 
and industry, as well as in the buildings sector. In the Other Countries grouping, only 
national policies are assumed to be adopted, covering all sectors. 
National initiatives have been the driving force behind much of the global abatement 
to date and will continue to play a role across all sectors, even those covered by other 
mechanisms,  to  ensure  that  practical  measures  for  achieving  sectoral  standards  or 
meeting  emissions  targets  are  put  in  place.  These  national  initiatives  are  likely  to 
include fiscal policy (such as carbon taxes and incentives for households and businesses 
to curb emissions), regulation, information provision, national procurement and public 
funding. As well as policies at the national level, local government policies, particularly 
in cities, have a major role to play in helping countries meet their national climate- 
change obligations (Box 17.6).
Box 17.6 z  CO

 savings potential of cities
There  is  a  very  large  potential  to  reduce  energy  use  and  CO 2   emissions  in 
cities, which currently account for over 70% of energy-related CO 2  emissions (see 
Chapter 16). Local governments can influence energy use in cities, both directly 
and indirectly, and often have policy instruments at their disposal which differ 
from  those  of  national  governments.  There  are  three  key  areas  where  local 
governments have significant policy influence which can be used to achieve energy 
and CO 2  savings:
Cities can encourage the use of integrated energy-production technology, such   z
as combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP). The density of demand for energy 
services  in  cities  provides  economies  of  scale  (less  infrastructure  unit  cost 
per capita) as well as greater energy efficiency due to low transmission and 
distribution losses.
Cities have considerable influence over passenger transport modes, particularly   z
for  short  trips.  The  provision  of  safe  pedestrian  and  bicycle  routes  can 
encourage residents to use these transport modes in preference to passenger 
vehicles. Land-use and planning powers can be used to create low-emission 
zones, impose congestion charges and improve public transport.
Local governments can also influence the efficiency of energy use in buildings.   z
In  particular,  local  governments  are  instrumental  in  enforcing  the  energy

components of buildings codes. Electricity production and heat generation in 
buildings can also be regulated through planning laws: Barcelona introduced 
a “Solar Thermal Ordinance”, a law requiring 60% of hot water to be supplied 
through solar thermal collectors. This approach was later adopted in a less- 
stringent form in the national building codes of Spain.
The importance of cities in addressing the challenges posed by climate change 
is gaining increased recognition, with several having already set climate targets 
(Table 17.4). In the 1990s, three major city networks working on climate change 
emerged:  The  Climate  Alliance;  ICLEI  Local  Governments  for  Sustainability  — 
Cities for Climate Protection Campaign; and Energie–Cités. In 2005, the C40 Cities 
—  Large  Cities  Climate  Leadership  Group  —  was  founded.  In  addition  to  the 
international city networks, a number of national networks have been formed 
or  have  re-orientated  their  work  towards  climate  change.  These  include  the 
Nottingham Declaration Partnership in the United Kingdom; the US Conference 
of  Mayors;  Canada’s  Partners  for  Climate  Protection;  the  Spanish  Network  of 
Cities for Climate; the Kyoto Club in Italy; and the Colgei (Coalition of Local 
Governments for Environment Initiative) Group in Japan. The activity of these 
networks can explain in large part the readiness of some cities to adopt specific 
greenhouse-gas abatement targets.
Despite the many initiatives that some cities have undertaken, only a few are 
actively pursuing CO 2 -mitigation policies. Significant obstacles include competing 
demands for resources, the tension between short re-election periods and long-
term infrastructure challenges, and lack of co-operation beyond city borders. 
National  governments  have  a  role  to  play  in  putting  in  place  incentives  to 
encourage cities to undertake CO 2 -abatement activities.

434 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Without  such  national  and  local  government  policies,  other  mechanisms  may  not 
deliver sufficient emissions abatement quickly enough. Price effects, for example, can 
take some time to feed through the system. In the European Union, emissions were flat 
between 2004 and 2006 in spite of energy-price increases equivalent to an increase of 
$30 per tonne of CO 2 .
National policies and measures in non-OECD countries
National policies and measures in non-OECD countries, which may not initially have 
quantified,  country-wide  obligations  under  a  post-2012  climate  framework,  will  be 
a  necessary  component  of  effective  international  abatement  action.  The  450  and 
550 Policy Scenarios both assume that a comprehensive set of national policies and 
measures, across all sectors, is adopted in the Other Countries group. In relation to the 
group of Other Major Economies, national policies and measures have been modelled 
for power generation, industry and buildings. 
It is important that countries’ emissions-reduction strategies take full account of their 
development  needs,  thereby  fitting  the  Bali  Action  Plan  description  of  “nationally 
appropriate mitigation actions … in the context of sustainable development”. One of 
the most prominent proposals is the Sustainable Development Policies and Measures 
(SD-PAMs)  model,  which  offers  an  opportunity  for  non-OECD  countries  to  reduce 
emissions through tailored, development-focused policies, guided by domestic priorities 
(Ellis et al., 2007). In the energy sector, policies that countries would be likely to 
pursue as SD-PAMs include measures to promote energy efficiency, the broader use of 
renewable energy sources, and steps to reduce energy subsidies without damaging the 
welfare of poorer sections of society.
Formalising the place of such national policies and measures in a global post-2012 
framework would help to ensure progress towards a global emissions goal. Such an 
approach would give full recognition to countries’ domestic actions and could help to 
direct technology financing and capacity-building. It could be an interim step towards 
country-wide,  quantified  emission-limitation  commitments,  based  on  the  sound 
integration of climate-policy objectives into domestic policy.

CLIMATE POLICY SCENARIOS
The road from Copenhagen?
In the 550 Policy Scenario, total greenhouse gas emissions plateau by 2020 and   z
reach 48 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030. Global energy-related CO
2
 emissions peak in 2025 
and then decline slightly to 33 Gt in 2030. Both total greenhouse-gas and energy-
related CO
2
 emissions are 19% lower in 2030 than in the Reference Scenario. 
Energy-related CO
2
 emissions from OECD+ countries are one-fifth lower in 2030 
than in 2006. Other Major Economies see an increase of around 60% from 2006 to 
2030, instead of a doubling in the Reference Scenario.
The carbon price in OECD+ reaches $90/tonne of CO  z
2
 in 2030 in the 550 Policy 
Scenario. This, together with sectoral agreements and national policies in Other 
Major Economies and Other Countries, lead to substantial changes in the global 
energy  mix:  total  energy  demand  in  2030  is  9%  lower  than  in  the  Reference 
Scenario, mainly as a result of efficiency gains. The role of renewable energy, 
mainly wind, rises, while demand for coal falls 27% and that of both gas and oil 
declines by 8%. Lower fossil-fuel demand results in substantial co-benefits in the 
form of reduced energy imports and local air pollution.
Oil demand in the 550 Policy Scenario rises to 95 mb/d in 2020 (4 mb/d less than   z
in the Reference Scenario) and to 98 mb/d (almost 9 mb/d less) in 2030. More 
than half of the savings in world oil demand occur in the transport sector in 
OECD+ and Other Major Economies, as a result of the introduction of international 
sectoral agreements on reducing emissions from light-duty vehicles and aviation. 
Oil  prices  reach  $100 per  barrel  in  2030,  18%  lower  than  in  the  Reference 
Scenario, due to the lower demand. OPEC production still increases, to 49 mb/d 
in 2030, almost 13 mb/d higher than today. 
In  the  450  Policy  Scenario,  emissions  fall  sharply  after  2020,  in  contrast  to   z
their stabilisation in the 550 Policy Scenario, as a result of much stronger and 
broader policy action. Other Major Economies, in addition to OECD+ countries, 
are assumed to participate in a cap-and-trade system, which results in a carbon 
price  of  $180/tonne  of  CO
2
.  Hydropower,  biomass  and  other  renewables  see 
faster deployment in power generation, accounting for 40% of total electricity 
generation  worldwide  in  2030.  Global  energy-related  CO
2
  emissions  peak  in 
2020 at 32.5 Gt and then decline to 25.7 Gt in 2030. This scenario would require 
energy-related CO
2
 emissions in OECD+ countries to be reduced by almost 40% in 
2030 compared to 2006 levels and Other Major Economies to limit their growth to 
around 20% compared with 2006.

436 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Both  climate-policy  scenarios  involve  substantial  reductions  in  greenhouse-gas   z
emissions before 2020, resulting from appropriate policies and technology deployment. 
This would require a credible regulatory framework, the gradual development of a 
global carbon market and sustained investment in research and development.
Methodology and assumptions
Modelling approach
This  chapter  presents  the  results  of  WEO-2008’s  two  climate  policy  scenarios: 
the  450  Policy  Scenario,  which  leads  to  the  stabilisation  of  greenhouse  gases  at 
450 ppm CO 2 -eq, and the 550 Policy Scenario, leading to stabilisation at 550 ppm. Each 
scenario  combines  the  three  climate  policy  mechanisms  discussed  in  Chapter  17  — 
cap-and-trade, sectoral agreements, and national policies and measures. The portfolio 
of policy mechanisms is tailored, on a sector-by-sector basis, to the economic and policy 
circumstances of three country groupings, namely OECD+, Other Major Economies and 
Other Countries (see Annex B for definitions). We apply these mechanisms as follows:
In the power-generation and industry sectors, in both scenarios, OECD+ countries   
participate in a cap-and-trade system. In the 450 Policy Scenario only, given the need 
for much more substantial emissions reduction post-2020, Other Major Economies 
also conform to emissions caps in these sectors from 2020.
In both OECD+ and Other Major Economies, we assume that sectoral agreements   
are  adopted  in  both  scenarios  in  the  iron  and  steel,  cement,  and  vehicle-  and 
aircraft-manufacturing  sectors,  drawing  on  the  potential  of  the  best  available 
technologies.
In both scenarios, national policies and measures are assumed to be adopted in the   
buildings sector in OECD+, in buildings, power generation and industry sectors in 
Other Major Economies, and across all sectors in Other Countries.
The  450  and  550  Policy  Scenarios  use  the  World  Energy  Model  (WEM)  to  assess  the 
implications  of  these  policies  —  at  global,  regional  and  sectoral  levels  —  on  energy 
demand, the energy mix, energy-related CO 2  emissions and investment. CO 2  prices under 
the cap-and-trade regime have also been calculated.
In the 550 Policy Scenario, the total energy-related CO 2  emissions arising from the above 
policies amounts to 32.9 Gt in 2030. Of this, the cap on power generation and industry 
in OECD+ is some 4.7 Gt in 2030. This corresponds to a reduction of 32% relative to 
these sectors’ emissions in OECD+ in the Reference Scenario. Across all sectors, OECD+ 
emissions in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario are around 20% below 2006 levels.
The  450  Policy  Scenario  follows  a  similar  CO 2   emissions  trajectory  to  the  550  Policy 
Scenario until 2020, but then diverges sharply downwards to an emissions level of 25.7 Gt 
in 2030. From 2020, the cap on the power-generation and industry sectors in OECD+ 
countries is more stringent and these sectors’ emissions are also capped in Other Major 
Economies from this date. Across all sectors, energy-related CO 2  emissions in OECD+ in 
2030 are reduced by around 40% in the 450 Policy Scenario, compared to 2006 levels. In 
Other Major Economies, the level in 2030 is still around 20% higher than in 2006.

Economic growth
There  is  abundant  literature  estimating  the  impact  of  policy  action  to  reduce 
emissions on economic growth. Most studies have focused on the long-term impact 
of  stabilisation  at  550 ppm  CO
2
-equivalent  (CO
2
-eq)  or  more,  though  increasing 
attention  has  also  been  given  recently  to  450 ppm  CO
2
-eq  stabilisation.  Recent 
estimates of the losses of global GDP in 2030 which are attributable to action to cut 
the atmospheric concentration of emissions to 550 ppm are in the range of 0.2% to 
2.5% of world output. The few estimates that exist for 450 ppm are in the range of 
0.5% to around 3% (Table 18.1).

Some model simulations in the literature assume implementation pathways for each 
mitigation policy which are perfectly cost-effective: this certainly underestimates the 
actual implementation costs. Global GDP losses are highly dependent upon the type 
of policy implemented, how revenues from emissions trading are redistributed, the 
effectiveness of financing mechanisms and the trajectory of the decarbonisation path 
during the transition. Given the uncertainties, we have not tried to quantify the impact 
of our Policy Scenarios on GDP. However, we have calculated the additional energy-
related investment costs of the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios as a proportion of GDP 
(based on the GDP level in the Reference Scenario).
Energy prices 
In both climate-policy scenarios, energy prices differ significantly from those in the 
Reference Scenario. They are, however, assumed to be the same in both climate-policy 
scenarios. Demand reduction in the 450 Policy Scenario goes well beyond that in the 
550 Policy Scenario, which would normally put additional downward pressure on prices. 
However, in the 450 Policy Scenario, we expect production costs for oil (and other fossil 
fuels) to increase relative to the 550 Policy Scenario, mainly as a result of higher carbon 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
438 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
prices, which in this scenario also cover key producing regions, such as the Middle East 
and Russia. Overall, we assume that these two factors will broadly offset each other, 
leaving energy prices at the same level in both scenarios. 
On this basis, it is assumed that fossil-fuel prices in both scenarios fall relative to 
the Reference Scenario in response to lower oil, gas and coal demand, the decline 
in  demand  stemming  from  the  introduction  of  new  and  additional  policies  aimed 
at improving energy efficiency and increasing the shares of nuclear and renewable 
energies. Lower oil demand means there is less need to produce oil from costly fields 
higher up the supply curve in non-OPEC countries. As a result, oil prices are lower 
than  in  the  Reference  Scenario  after  2015,  when  most  of  the  fields  already  under 
construction  will  have  been  completed  and  the  impact  of  reduced  demand  is  felt 
by producers. Oil prices remain at $100 per barrel in 2030 — a fall of $22, or 18%, 
compared with the Reference Scenario.
As in the Reference Scenario, natural gas prices are assumed broadly to follow the 
trend in oil prices, because of the continuing widespread use of oil-price indexation 
in long-term gas supply contracts. Natural gas prices in Pacific, North American and 
European hubs are between 18% and 19% lower in 2030 than in the Reference Scenario. 
Coal  import  prices  are  also  affected  by  the  different  supply-demand  equilibrium. 
The contraction of the coal market is assumed to drive down coal prices relative to 
the Reference Scenario, especially towards the end of the Outlook period when coal 
demand falls most heavily. Coal prices increase from $65 per tonne in 2006 to $120 in 
2015, then fall to $85 in 2030, compared with $110 in 2030 in the Reference Scenario 
— a reduction of 23%. 
Electricity prices increase, reflecting carbon penalties and the higher costs of lower-
carbon power-generation technologies. The biggest increases, unsurprisingly, occur in 
countries where cap-and-trade is applied (Figure 18.1).

Carbon prices 
In  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  the  carbon  price  that  results  from  the  cap-and-trade 
mechanism reaches $40 per tonne of CO
2
 in 2020 and $90 in 2030 in OECD+ countries. 
The price increases over time, as the least-expensive mitigation options are exploited 
first. A lot of unexploited cheap options could exist in Other Countries. A more effective 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) than the current one could help tap part of that 
potential. In the 550 Policy Scenario, another interesting unexploited option lies in the 
power sector in Other Major Economies. There could be a significant flow of capital and 
technology from OECD+ to Other Major Economies if the latter were to set “no-lose” 
targets  to  carry  them  beyond  the  emission  reductions  achieved  through  national 
policies and measures in the period 2020-2030 (see Box 17.3 in Chapter 17). There 
would be mutual benefits: OECD+ countries would have access to a large CO
2 
market, 
generating a lower price than that in OECD+ alone; Other Major Economies would gain 
from the flow of capital and technology from OECD+ countries (see Chapter 19). 
In the 450 Policy Scenario, carbon prices in OECD+ countries in 2030 reach $180, twice 
as high as in the 550 Policy Scenario, because the stringency of the cap is greater. The 
price emerging in Other Major Economies is initially lower than that in OECD+ countries, 
because we assume most of the CO
2
 reductions occur domestically, with limited linkage 
between the two markets. The prices in Other Major Economies converge to that in 
OECD+ countries towards 2030.
Overview of the results of the climate scenarios
Primary energy demand
550 Policy Scenario
In  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  world  primary  energy  demand  expands  by  about  32% 
between 2006 and 2030, to reach nearly 15 500 Mtoe, an average annual increase of 
1.2%, compared with the faster rate of 1.6% in the Reference Scenario (Table 18.2).

440 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
The rate of demand growth falls to 0.8% per year from 2020-2030, after running at 
1.5% per year in the period 2006-2020. This is a more pronounced drop-off in growth 
than that seen in the Reference Scenario, with energy intensity falling faster in the 
550 Policy  Scenario  than  in  the  Reference  Scenario,  particularly  towards  the  end 
of the Outlook period. By 2030, primary energy intensity is 9% lower than in the 
Reference Scenario.
Total primary energy demand in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario is some 1 500 Mtoe 
lower  than  in  the  Reference  Scenario.  Other  Major  Economies  account  for  58%  of 
this, OECD+ for 28% and Other Countries for 14%. OECD+ countries limit their increase 
in  energy  demand  from  2006  to  2030  to  4%,  while  energy  demand  in  Other  Major 
Economies  rises  by  70%  over  the  same  period.  Energy  demand  in  Other  Countries 
follows a middle path, being 35% higher in 2030 than in 2006.
Coal demand in 2030 drops most, in both absolute and percentage terms, compared 
to the Reference Scenario (Figure 18.2). Over the projection period, it grows by 0.7% 
per year on average in the 550 Policy Scenario, compared with 2% per year in the 
Reference Scenario. It increases by 21% from 2006 to 2020, and declines thereafter. The 
introduction of national policies and measures in Other Major Economies — in particular 
policies to promote energy efficiency, nuclear, renewables and more efficient coal-
fired power plants — accounts for the bulk of the difference in coal demand between 
the Reference Scenario and the 550 Policy Scenario. In 2030, coal demand is still 17% 
higher than today.

due to the introduction of international sectoral agreements for light-duty vehicles and 
aviation, oil demand in OECD+ in 2030 is 15% lower than today. More efficient vehicles 
and the expansion of biofuels are not sufficient to offset the impact of rising vehicle 
ownership in Other Major Economies and Other Countries where, together, oil demand 
expands by around 60%. Natural gas demand is projected to grow by 1.4% per year, 
compared with 1.8% in the Reference Scenario, with the reduction occurring mostly in 
Other Major Economies. 
The share in the world primary energy mix of low-carbon energy, such as hydropower, 
nuclear,  biomass  and  renewables,  increases  from  19%  in  2006  to  25%  in  2030. 
Hydropower demand increases in the 550 Policy Scenario to reach 456 Mtoe in 2030, 
compared with 414 Mtoe in the Reference Scenario. Other renewables, such as wind 
and solar, receive a much bigger boost, rising seven-fold from just 66 Mtoe in 2006 to 
the same level as hydro in 2030. Modern biomass use also increases — both in power 
generation  and  in  decentralised  heat  production  for  residential,  commercial  and 
industry needs — to around 1 200 Mtoe in 2030. Nuclear grows twice as fast as in the 
Reference Scenario to reach nearly 1 100 Mtoe in 2030.
450 Policy Scenario
In  the  450  Policy  Scenario,  primary  energy  demand  grows  at  an  average  0.8%  per 
year to 2030, half the rate of growth in the Reference Scenario. Demand approaches 
14 400 Mtoe in 2030 — a reduction of about 7% relative to the 550 Policy Scenario 
and 16% relative to the Reference Scenario (Table 18.3). The annual saving compared 
with the Reference Scenario is comparable to the current energy demand of OECD 
North  America.  The  reduction  in  the  use  of  fossil  fuels  (over  4 000 Mtoe  in  2030 
relative to the Reference Scenario) is partially offset by an increase in low-carbon

fuels (nearly 1 400 Mtoe). Despite the sharp decline in fossil-fuel use, relative to the 
Reference Scenario, fossil fuels still account for 67% of primary energy demand in 2030, 
14 percentage points less than today. 
Coal demand in the 450 Policy Scenario peaks around 2020 and declines thereafter: 
the level in 2030 is close to that of 2002. Coal accounts for more than 60% of the 
reduction  in  fossil-fuel  use,  relative  to  the  Reference  Scenario.  Two-thirds  of 
the  reduction  in  coal  use  occurs  in  Other  Major  Economies,  mainly  in  the  power 
sectors of China and India, due to the introduction of a carbon price in Other Major 
Economies after 2020. OECD+ countries account for 30% of the global decrease in 
coal consumption. Their domestic coal use — facing a carbon price of around $180 
per tonne of CO
2
 in 2030 — is cut sharply, by two-thirds in 2030 compared with the 
Reference Scenario.
Oil demand in this scenario increases through to 2020 reaching 94.6 mb/d, but then 
its use declines to just under 90 mb/d in 2030. Oil demand expands on average at 
0.3% per year over the Outlook period. More-stringent sectoral agreements for light-
duty vehicles (LDVs) are responsible for the bulk of the savings. Oil use is reduced 
by around 17% in 2030, relative to the Reference Scenario, in both OECD+ and Other 
Major Economies, and by 11% in Other Countries. In OECD+ countries, oil demand 
declines steadily to less than 80% of today’s levels in 2030. Demand continues to 
expand elsewhere, by around 60% in Other Major Economies and by around 20% in 
Other Countries. 
Gas demand expands throughout the period to 2030, growing at 0.9% per year — 
half the growth rate of the Reference Scenario. Savings in gas demand are evenly 
distributed between OECD+ and Other Major Economies, each region accounting for 
close to 40% of global savings. The carbon price in the power sector makes low-carbon 
generation  more  attractive  than  gas.  Higher  electricity  prices  in  the  residential 
sector encourage energy efficiency and renewable investment, which reduce the use 
of fossil fuels.
Nuclear (increasing by 51% from the Reference Scenario in 2030), hydropower (+33%), 
modern biomass (+60%) and other renewables, such as wind and solar (+95%), all 
experience  sharp  growth  relative  to  the  Reference  Scenario. The  carbon  price  in 
OECD+ and Other Major Economies makes renewables more competitive than fossil 
fuels and encourages faster deployment for heat and power than in the Reference 
Scenario in all countries.

In the 550 Policy Scenario, energy-related CO

 emissions in 2030 are 10.4 Gt in the 
OECD+ countries, as opposed to 13.4 Gt in the Reference Scenario — one-fifth lower 
than in 2006, instead of 3% higher, as in the Reference Scenario (Table 18.4). The 
Other Major Economies group, on the other hand, still generates a large increase in 
emissions in the 550 Policy Scenario, but to a lesser degree than in the Reference 
Scenario:  a  61%  increase  from  2006  to  2030,  instead  of  the  doubling  seen  in  the 
Reference Scenario. Emissions from Other Major Economies overtake those of OECD+ 
by 2012, to reach 16.8 Gt in 2030. In Other Countries, the percentage reduction, 
compared with the Reference Scenario, is not as large as for the other two groups, 
but is still substantial — 13% in 2030.  CO
2
 emissions from Other Countries increase by 
26% to 4.4 Gt in 2030, as opposed to the 45% increase to 5 Gt seen in the Reference 
Scenario.
In the 550 Policy Scenario, world CO
2
 emissions per capita increase from 4.3 tonnes 
in 2006 to 4.4 tonnes in 2015, before falling back to 4.0 tonnes in 2030. This is in 
contrast  to  the  Reference  Scenario,  where  global  per-capita  emissions  rise  steeply 
to 4.7 tonnes in 2015 and continue to rise thereafter, to 4.9 tonnes in 2030. OECD+ 
countries are largely responsible for the eventual decline in per-capita emissions in the 
550 Policy Scenario. Per-capita CO
2
 emissions in those countries decline steeply, from 
10.6 tonnes in 2006 to 9.2 tonnes in 2020 and 7.8 tonnes in 2030. Per-capita emissions 
in Other Major Economies increase, from 3.3 tonnes in 2006 to 4.4 tonnes in 2030. 
The difference is made all the more striking by the fact that population grows at just 
0.4% per year in OECD+ over the Outlook period, compared with 0.8% in Other Major 
Economies.

 emissions from coal use in the 550 Policy Scenario increase by 10% between 2006 
and 2030, but that is dramatically lower than the 60% increase seen in the Reference 
Scenario over the same period. Coal emissions are 1.2 Gt higher in 2030 than in 2006. 
In this same scenario, emissions from oil equal those from coal in 2030, while in the 
Reference Scenario coal emissions are 36% greater than those from oil. This reflects the 
paucity of alternatives to oil in the transport sector, highlighting the fact that finding 
a substitute for oil in transport is a key issue not only for security of supply but also 
for climate-change mitigation. Gas-related emissions increase most over the Outlook 
period — 2.1 Gt (38%) — mainly due to fuel switching in the power sector. However, this 
is less than the 2.8 Gt (52%) increase in the Reference Scenario.
The 550 Policy Scenario sees a decline in CO
2
 intensity (tonnes of CO
2
 emissions from 
energy use per unit of GDP, at fixed purchasing power parities) at a rate of 2.6% per 
year over the Outlook period. In the Reference Scenario, the rate of decline at world 
level  is  just  1.7%  per  year.  The  average  quantity  of  CO
2
  emitted  per  tonne  of  oil 
equivalent of fossil energy used worldwide is projected to decrease from 2.94 tonnes 
in 2006 to 2.83 tonnes in 2030, reflecting the decline in coal consumption. 
A significant proportion of the reduction in emissions is derived from the implementation 
of national policies and measures, particularly in Other Major Economies. The primary 
motivation behind the adoption of national policies and measures is often not climate 
change but a quest for greater security of supply, greater efficiency or lower local 
pollution. Therefore, related greenhouse-gas emission reductions can be considered a 
co-benefit. As these benefits in terms of greenhouse-gas abatement may not be subject 
to any verification or enforcement, however, there is no certainty that they will be 
achieved. The policies listed in Table 18.5 have particularly significant impacts.

Reference  Scenario.  The  large-scale  deployment  of  renewable  and  carbon  capture 
and storage (CCS) technologies in the power sector gives rise to 1.2 and 0.8 Gt of CO

savings, respectively. The decarbonisation of the power sector alone involves notably 
the construction every year to 2030 of an additional 7 coal-fired plants and 3 gas-
fired plants with CCS, 11 new nuclear plants and almost 12 000 wind turbines, while 
hydropower is expanded every two years by 64 GW — the equivalent of three dams of  
the capacity of China’s Three Gorges Dam. 1

In the 450 Policy Scenario, energy-efficiency improvements result in reduced demand 
across  all  sectors  and  energy  supply  shows  a  significant  increase  in  all  low-carbon 
technologies,  compared  with  the  550  Policy  Scenario.  Global  energy-related  CO
2
 
emissions in 2030 increase by 23% relative to those in 1990 but fall 8% relative to 2006. 
The rate of decarbonisation of the energy sector required after 2020 is unprecedented, 
responding to a need to achieve an average annual emissions reduction of 0.67 Gt. This 
compares with an annual average increase of 0.75 Gt in the period 2000-2006. Fossil- 
fuel demand and energy-related CO 
2
 emissions decline in all sectors in OECD+ between 
2006 and 2030, but increase in all sectors in Other Major Economies. There is a slight 
increase in fossil-fuel demand and energy-related CO
2
 emissions in Other Countries.
Energy-related CO 
2
 emissions in Other Major Economies peak in 2020 at around 15 Gt 
(2 Gt less than in the Reference Scenario). After the assumed introduction of a carbon 
price at this time, they decline steeply to 12 Gt in 2030. Emissions in OECD+ are in steep 
decline, being 3 Gt, or 30%, lower in 2030 than in 1990. Emissions in Other Countries

also peak in 2020, as they benefit from technological spillovers from OECD+ and Other 
Major Economies. In absolute terms, Other Major Economies account for the largest 
savings in 2030, compared to the Reference Scenario (8.3 Gt, or 56% of global savings). 
OECD+ countries reduce their emissions relative to the Reference Scenario by 5.2 Gt, 
or 36% of global emissions savings, while Other Countries reduce theirs by 1.2 Gt or 
8%. The reduction in CO
2
 in end-use sectors in Other Countries, compared with the 550 
Policy Scenario, is very small because we do not assume major changes in the national 
policies of these countries, given their relatively low income and emission levels. 
In the more-stringent 450 Policy Scenario, a deeper transformation of energy supply 
and an even wider adoption of CO
2
-mitigation options occurs (Figure 18.4). In order to 
achieve the necessary additional reduction between the 550 and 450 Policy Scenarios, 
further end-use efficiency improvements are assumed. Renewable energy is developed 
considerably further, to realise a further 25% CO
2
-emissions reduction compared to the 
550 Policy Scenario. CCS technologies are applied more widely in power generation, 
but are also introduced in the industry sector. Thirteen additional nuclear power plants 
have to be built yearly, compared to the 550 Policy Scenario. Biofuels penetrate the 
transportation sector more deeply.
Box 18.1 z  Outlook for energy-related CO
2
 emissions to 2050
In the 450 Policy Scenario, global CO
2
 emissions increase from 27.9 Gt in 2006 to 
32.5 Gt in 2020, then fall to 25.7 Gt in 2030. This trend is in line with the BLUE 
Map Scenario presented in the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, which 
leads to global CO
2
 emissions of 14 Gt in 2050. The BLUE Map scenario shows the 
technology revolution that will be needed in the next four decades if such deep 
emission cuts are to be achieved. This long-term view is important as guidance 
for planning because options that are still costly will need government-supported 
deployment  in  the  years  2020-2030  so  as  to  become  competitive  after  2030. 
Important insights are that the power sector needs to be virtually decarbonised, 
carbon capture and storage must be widely deployed, light-duty vehicles will 
become  electric  or  hybrid,  and  biofuels  will  be  needed  for  aviation,  marine 
and heavy-duty vehicles. Such a scenario would result in a 27% reduction of oil 
demand in 2050 compared to 2005, reducing the need for oil capacity additions.
Emissions of gases other than energy-related CO
2
As much as a third of the required reduction in greenhouse gases may have to come 
from gases other than energy-related CO
2
. These gases currently make up nearly 40% 
of total emissions (see Chapter 16). To achieve either 550 ppm or 450 ppm CO
2
-eq 
stabilisation in the long term will require not only significant emissions reductions of 
CO
2
 in the energy sector by 2030, but also aggressive reductions of CO
2
 emissions from

448 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
industry and land use, and reduction of all the other greenhouse gases as well. Neither 
the 550 nor 450 ppm CO
2
-eq stabilisation targets can be achieved by action in the 
energy sector alone. 
Cap-and-trade policies for CO
2
 in the OECD+ will tend by 2030 to set the international 
carbon price that will also be applied to all the other greenhouse gases across all 
sectors (although it is not yet clear exactly how this extension of a carbon-equivalent 
price would be implemented in practice). For both the 550 and 450 Policy Scenarios, 
analysis carried out by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
has provided a range of reduction potentials for each of the non-energy related CO
2
 
gases 2  and their various sources, compared with the Reference Scenario. The marginal 
abatement costs vary across sectors and over time. For the purpose of our scenarios, 
the extent of the potential reduction of each gas in 2030 was calculated from the 
abatement costs after the future price of carbon had been determined. Emissions of 
CO
2
 from land-use change were based on OECD projections (OECD, 2008). 3  They are 
projected to decline in all scenarios by 2030, to a level around half that of current 
emissions. For Other Major Economies and Other Countries, it is assumed that the 
CDM  remains  in  place  and  includes  all  gases. The  potential  emission  reductions  in 
these regions can be considered a component of any carbon off-setting mechanism, 
although if a limit is set to off-setting in the OECD+, this would limit the flow of CDM 
credits.
550 Policy Scenario 
In the 550 Policy Scenario, the inclusion of the power generation and industry sectors in 
a cap-and-trade scheme for OECD+ resulted in a carbon price of $90 per tonne of CO
2
 in 
2030. Significant reduction of most of the non-energy-related CO
2
 and other gases can 
be achieved in all regions at this 2030 marginal abatement cost or less. The exceptions 
include landfill methane and nitrous oxide from adipic acid production in the Other 
Countries, where only half of the potential out to 2030 is thought to be realisable at 
this carbon price.  
From 2005 4  to 2030, emissions of all types of greenhouse gases rise only 9% in the 
550 Policy Scenario, from 44.2 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2005 to 48.2 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030 (Figure 18.5). 
This is around 20% less than in the Reference Scenario, where total emissions rise to 
59.6 Gt CO
2
-eq in 2030. For each of the greenhouse gases, these reductions in emissions 
occur progressively as a result of improved process efficiencies, better agricultural 
management, reduced leakages and less gas flaring. The share of non-energy-related 
gases decreases from around 39% of total emissions in 2005 to 32% in 2030.

450 Policy Scenario
Since most potential reductions of non-energy-related gases are achieved at a 2030 
marginal abatement cost of $90 per tonne of CO
2
 or less, the higher carbon price of the 
450 Policy Scenario creates little further reduction potential. The share of non-energy-
related gases in 2030 increases to 35%, being 3 percentage points greater than in the 
550 Policy Scenario, since energy-related CO
2
 emissions decline faster (Figure 18.5).
In the 450 Policy Scenario, total emissions peak in 2020 then drop to 34% below the level 
of the Reference Scenario in 2030. In absolute terms, total greenhouse-gas emissions 
decline to 39.3 Gt CO

-eq in 2030, 8.9 Gt CO

and 4.9 Gt CO

non-CO
2
 gases in 2030, compared with the Reference Scenario, whereas both Other 
Major Economies and Other Countries show a 25% reduction. There is little change 
between the 550 and 450 Policy Scenarios in the regional shares of non-CO
2
 emissions 
in 2030. As for the effects on the different gases, industry-related CO
2
 emissions in the 
450 Policy Scenario are 25% lower in 2030, than in the 550 Policy Scenario, methane 
emissions 16% lower, nitrous oxide 4% and F-gases 14%.

450 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
The 550 Policy Scenario: results by sector 
Power generation
In  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  OECD+  countries  are  assumed  to  implement  policies  to 
encourage the deployment of low-carbon technologies in the power-generation sector, 
in  addition  to  a  cap-and-trade  system.  Cap-and-trade  arrangements  are  already  in 
place or are being considered in most OECD+ countries. Such explicit pricing of carbon 
makes renewables, nuclear and CCS technologies more competitive against fossil-fuel 
based electricity generation. But in OECD+ countries, successful deployment of low-
carbon power generation technologies requires more than carbon pricing alone. For 
example, the successful deployment of renewable energy requires political effort in 
various ways, including:
Research  and  development  programmes  to  reduce  the  cost  of  advanced   
technologies.
Targeted support mechanisms to speed up the deployment of technologies close to   
market competitiveness.
Development of grids to integrate renewables.  
Public acceptance and support.  
OECD+  countries  in  both  climate  scenarios  are  therefore  assumed  to  put  in  place 
specific  policies  to  speed  up  the  deployment  of  low-carbon  technologies,  to 
supplement  emissions-trading  schemes.  Many  governments  already  favour  the  use 
of renewable energy, as a means both of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and of 
increasing reliance on domestic energy sources. Typical measures include guaranteed 
feed-in tariffs and portfolio standards requiring a stated proportion of generation to 
come from renewables. The Policy Scenarios assume that measures are also adopted to 
extend the lifetime of existing nuclear power plants and to accelerate the construction 
of new ones. Along with market incentives stemming from the implementation of a 
carbon price, the deployment of CCS technology is assumed to be accelerated through 
support for a number of pilot demonstration projects, leading to commercialisation 
around 2020. The Policy Scenarios assume that significant research and development 
programmes are put in place, as well as support for the deployment of CCS in OECD+ 
countries.
The power sector in Other Major Economies and Other Countries is assumed not to face 
binding emissions caps in the 550 Policy Scenario. However, it is considered that the 
Other Major Economies group would participate by implementing national policies and 
measures, such as green certificates schemes aimed at enhancing the use of renewable 
energy sources. The most important policies for Other Major Economies considered in 
the Policy Scenarios include:
Policies to improve the efficiency of fossil-fuel plants, leading to a greater number   
of high-efficiency ultrasupercritical and integrated gasification combined-cycle coal 
plants, rather than conventional subcritical units.

Chapter 18 - Climate policy scenarios 451
18
Policies to encourage the reduction of electricity transmission and distribution losses   
by accelerating the upgrading of existing systems.
Incentives and regulations to boost the deployment of renewables. For example,   
China adopted a renewable energy law in 2005 and India has taken steps to provide 
more  incentives  for  renewables  and  already  has  a  thriving  wind-power  industry. 
In Brazil, the federal Programme of Incentives for Alternative Electricity Sources 
(PROINFA) is another example.
Policies  to  accelerate  the  construction  of  nuclear  power  plants.  A  number  of   
countries, including Russia, China and India, have ambitious plans to expand the use 
of nuclear power, with specific development targets. 
Impact on electricity generation and CO

 intensity
In the 550 Policy Scenario, new policies cut power-sector CO
2
 emissions to 12.8 Gt in 
2030, a reduction of 29% compared with the Reference Scenario, bringing an energy 
security  co-benefit  through  reduced  fuel  import  dependence.  World  electricity 
generation reaches a little over 30 000 TWh in 2030, 9% lower than in the Reference 
Scenario,  mainly  as  a  result  of  end-use  efficiency  improvements  (Table  18.6).

452 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Over half of the savings occur in Other Major Economies and Other Countries, where 
the potential to improve end-use efficiency is greatest.
Emissions per unit of electricity produced drop substantially in the 550 Policy Scenario, 
mainly  because  of  the  larger  shares  in  the  electricity  mix  of  nuclear  power  and 
renewables,  and  because  of  switching  from  coal  to  gas  (Figure  18.6).  Overall,  the 
electricity mix decarbonises at a rate of 1.5% per year compared with 0.4% in the 
Reference Scenario. This is higher than the 0.6% average annual rate of decarbonisation 
in the period 1970-1990.
The general introduction of a cap-and-trade scheme for power generation in OECD+ 
countries  leads  to  CO
2
  emissions  reductions  in  these  countries  through  short-term 
switching from coal to gas and through a shift towards low-carbon power-generation 
technologies  for  new  investment.  In  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  OECD+  power-sector 
emissions are roughly stable through to 2012 and start falling thereafter. In 2020 and 
2030 they are, respectively, 16% and 35% lower than in 2006. 
In Other Countries, national policies and measures lead to a decrease of 21% in CO
2
 
emissions from power plants in 2030, compared to the Reference Scenario, although 
they still increase from 1.3 Gt in 2006 to 1.6 Gt in 2030. Emissions from power plants in 
China and India in 2030 are, respectively, 4.4 Gt and 1.3 Gt, or 29% and 26% lower than 
in the Reference Scenario.

reduced by three percentage points in Other Major Economies and by two percentage 
points in Other Countries, compared with the Reference Scenario.
The global power-generation mix
By 2030, the share of fossil fuels in the electricity generation mix falls from 66% in the 
Reference Scenario to 55% in the 550 Policy Scenario, the current share being 67%. The 
largest fall is in the share of coal, which drops to 32% in 2030 — 12 percentage points 
lower than in the Reference Scenario (Figure 18.7).

In OECD+ countries, the change in the electricity mix occurs mainly over the next 
15 years, while in Other Major Economies and Other Countries it is more pronounced 
in the second half of the  Outlook period, reflecting the different rates of capital-
stock  turnover.  Power  plants  are  long-lived  assets  and  the  evolution  of  the  power 
sector in the Policy Scenarios is highly constrained by this fact. The age profiles of 
existing power plants present a very contrasting picture, creating both a window of 
opportunity in OECD+ over the next decade and a risk of potentially substantial lock-in 
of CO
2
 emissions for decades to come from fossil-fuel plants to be built in Other Major 
Economies and Other Countries.
In  the  550  Policy  Scenario,  total  coal-fired  electricity  generation  reaches  over 
9 700 TWh in 2030, 33% less than in the Reference Scenario but still 26% higher than 
today (Figure 18.8). The total reduction in coal-fired generation is larger than the 
current level of coal-fired electricity generation in the OECD+. Most of the reduction 
in coal-fired generation takes place in China, India and the OECD+. Advanced power-
generation  technologies  become  available  earlier  than  in  the  Reference  Scenario, 
particularly cleaner coal technologies, leading to higher efficiency. China, the largest 
user of coal for power generation, is already promoting the development of advanced 
coal technologies.

The adoption of CCS occurs mostly in OECD+ countries, where it is already supported 
by specific research and development programmes. In 2030, the installed capacity of 
CCS plants amounts to 162 GW worldwide, of which 111 GW (about 70%) is in OECD+ 
countries. CCS development in Other Major Economies and Other Countries may need 
to be financed through international co-operation and financial transfers. 
The reduction of gas-fired generation in the 550 Policy Scenario is smaller than that 
of coal. There is less need for base- and mid-load gas-fired capacity, but gas is still 
the main fuel used in gas turbines to meet peak-load demand. Gas-fired electricity 
generation  is  5%  lower  in  2030  than  in  the  Reference  Scenario,  with  a  total  net 
reduction in 2030 of about 350 TWh. Gas-fired electricity generation still increases 
by nearly 350 TWh in OECD+, whereas it decreases by over 300 TWh in Other Major 
Economies and by over 350 TWh in Other Countries. The share of oil-fired plants in the 
power generation mix shrinks throughout the Outlook period; these plants represent 
only 2% of electricity generation worldwide in 2030.
Distributed generation — production of electricity close to where it is used — plays a 
greater role in the Policy Scenarios than in the Reference Scenario. It helps save fuel 
and reduce CO
2
 emissions because it reduces network losses. It also reduces the need 
for investment in transmission networks. It involves greater use of combined heat and 
power (CHP), mainly in industry, and renewables in buildings, including integrated solar 
photovoltaic. CHP generation (which improves the economics of gas-fired generation) 
relies mainly on gas and biomass, and represents 11% of global power generation in the 
550 Policy Scenario. Fuel cells using natural gas as a source of hydrogen have a growing 
market share, but from a very low base, and are used increasingly in CHP. In 2030 the 
installed capacity of fuel cells reaches 74 GW while their efficiency increases up to 70%.

In the 550 Policy Scenario, renewable energy systems play a major role in the global 
electricity mix, supplying 30% of total electricity in 2030 (up from 23% in the Reference 
Scenario). On a regional basis, the share of hydropower, biomass and other renewables 
increases  by  15 percentage  points  above  current  levels  in  the  OECD+.  The  most 
dramatic increase is projected for Europe, where 39% of electricity is generated from 
renewable sources in 2030. Renewables account for 20% of total electricity generation 
in the United States and 18% in Japan in 2030. In Other Major Economies and Other 
Countries, renewable energy supplies over 5 000 TWh in 2030. The share of renewables 
in China increases from 16% in the Reference Scenario to 26% in the 550 Policy Scenario, 
and the share in India from 14% to 24%.
More hydropower plants are built in the 550 Policy Scenario than in the Reference 
Scenario, mostly in Other Major Economies and Other Countries, where the unexploited 
potential is still large. In these regions, the share of hydropower reaches 22% in 2030, 
slightly higher than the current 21% level. Global hydropower capacity reaches around 
1 600 GW in 2030, compared with around 900 GW now and 1 400 GW in 2030 in the 
Reference Scenario. 
Electricity from biomass, wind, solar, geothermal and tide and wave power reaches 
nearly 3 800 TWh in 2030. Their share of electricity generation grows from 2% now to 
13% in 2030. Wind power and biomass grow the most (Figure 18.9). In 2030, wind energy 
supplies 1 360 TWh in OECD+, 443 TWh in Other Major Economies and 144 TWh in Other 
Countries. Biomass supplies 629 TWh in OECD+, 381 TWh in Other Major Economies and 
181 TWh in Other Countries. These increases are delivered through national policies 
and measures, as well as by projects financed through CDM, but faster deployment of 
renewables is also due to cost reductions resulting from learning spillover effects from 
OECD+ countries. In addition, higher electricity prices may encourage people to adopt 
even more renewables-based technologies, especially solar photovoltaic.

Globally, the share of nuclear power in electricity generation is 14% in 2030, compared 
with 15% now. In the OECD+, the 23% share of nuclear power in 2030 is the same as at 
present. Nuclear power represents 7% of total electricity generation in Other Major 
Economies and 7% in Other Countries in 2030 (Figure 18.10).

demand as a result of improved energy efficiency. Coal-fired capacity is reduced by 
762 GW while gas-fired capacity increases by 107 GW by 2030. There is about 440 GW of 
additional renewables in the 550 Policy Scenario. Nuclear power-generating capacity is 
100 GW higher in 2030 than in the Reference Scenario. Three-quarters of this increase 
take place in OECD+ countries.
Industry
In the 550 Policy Scenario, energy-related CO
2
 emissions from the industry sector in 
OECD+ are limited by the carbon price that results from the cap-and-trade system. 
Also, the iron and steel and the cement sectors in OECD+ and Other Major Economies 
are assumed to be covered by international sectoral agreements, under which these 
industries in each region need to reduce CO
2
 intensity by at least as much as the gap 
between  the  intensity  of  current  production  and  what  could  be  achieved  with  the 
deployment  of  the  currently  available  best  technologies.  We  assume  that  the  CO
2
 
intensity reduction reaches full potential by 2020 in all OECD+ regions and by 2030 in 
Other Major Economies. Other Countries are assumed to implement national policies 
and measures.
In the 550 Policy Scenario, global industry CO
2
 emissions reach 5.4 Gt by 2020 and 
5.5 Gt in 2030 — 14% lower than in the Reference Scenario (Figure 18.11). 6  Most of the 
reduction comes from Other Major Economies, reaching 0.7 Gt in 2030 and accounting 
for  82%  of  the  total  reduction  relative  to  the  Reference  Scenario.  This  is  because 
the  production  capacity  in  these  countries,  as  well  as  capacity  additions  over  the 
projection period, is much larger than in OECD+. In addition, there is more potential to 
reduce energy and CO
2
 intensity in Other Major Economies. The CO
2
 reduction relative 
to the Reference Scenario in OECD+ reaches 0.1 Gt, or 11% of the global reduction. 
Compared with 2006, however, CO
2
 emissions from OECD+ decline by 14%, while those 
from Other Major Economies rise by 43% and those from Other Countries rise by 22%. 
Emissions  from  coal  combustion  for  heat  generation,  which  are  reduced  by  19%  in 
2030 compared with the Reference Scenario, are more sharply curtailed than those 
from  other  fuels  because  in  OECD+  the  carbon  price  raises  the  coal  price  most  in 
percentage terms and because other regions also make efforts to shift away from coal 
use (Table 18.8). Compared with the Reference Scenario, global coal demand declines 
by 19% in 2030, while total energy  demand falls by 9% in industry. The share of coal in 
global industry CO
2
 emissions in 2030 is 56% in the 550 Policy Scenario, compared with 
60% in the Reference Scenario. Of all industry sub-sectors, the iron and steel sector 
curbs emissions most, accounting for around one-third of the reduction in industry 
emissions in the 550 Policy Scenario, compared with the Reference Scenario. The sub-
sectors making the next greatest reductions are the non-metallic minerals and the 
chemicals and petrochemicals sectors.

from coal consumption, as end-use industry coal prices more than double, rising at a 
rate much faster than other energy due to coal’s relatively high carbon content. Coal 
accounts for 55% of total industry sector CO
2
 emissions savings in 2030. Emissions from 
the  iron  and  steel  sector  decline  most,  accounting  for  27%  of  the  total  reduction, 
followed by the chemicals and petrochemicals sector with 18%. 
In  the  Other  Major  Economies  group  of  countries,  CO
2
  emissions  in  the  550  Policy 
Scenario reach 3.4 Gt in 2030, 18% lower than in the Reference Scenario. Emissions 
from coal are expected to be reduced more than emissions from other fuels in both 
absolute and percentage terms, most of the reduction coming from China’s iron and 
steel and cement sectors. Initiatives have already been taken in China, such as the Top-
1000 Enterprises Energy Conservation Programme and the closing of inefficient, small-
scale plants in energy-intensive industries (see WEO-2007). Such measures in Other 
Major Economies are assumed to be enhanced in the 550 Policy Scenario. Emissions 
from the iron and steel sector in 2030 are reduced by 17% and the reduction in the non-
metallic minerals sector reaches 22%. Emissions from Other Countries also fall, due to 
the implementation of national policies and measures and technology transfer from 
more advanced regions. The reduction in the 550 Policy Scenario amounts to 64 Mt CO
2
 
by 2030, or 7% of Reference Scenario emissions.
CO
2
 emissions from the iron and steel sector worldwide grow from 1.4 Gt in 2006 to 
1.7 Gt in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario, 16% lower than in the Reference Scenario. 7  
Different  production  processes  have  very  different  levels  of  energy  and  carbon 
efficiency.    Electric  arc  furnaces  with  scrap  steel  produce  less  than  one-third  of 
the CO
2
 emissions per unit of production of typical blast furnaces — though electric 
arc furnace potential is limited by the availability of scrap steel — and less than 
20% of those from the coal-based direct reduced iron process (IEA, 2008a). In the 
550 Policy Scenario, wider use of electric arc furnaces is expected, in addition to 
improvements  in  blast  furnaces.  In  the  cement  sector,  emissions  are  almost  flat 
during the projection period. 8  Efficiency improves over time as small-scale vertical 
shaft kilns are replaced by more efficient large-scale rotary dry kilns. Emissions from 
the chemicals and petrochemicals sector in the 550 Policy Scenario grow from 0.6 Gt 
in 2006 to 0.7 Gt in 2030. 9   
Although there is significant variation in production processes between regions, energy 
indicator work carried out by the IEA allows us to estimate CO
2
 reduction potentials 
by region if best-available technology was applied worldwide (IEA, 2008b). 10  The CO
2
 
reduction potential in the iron and steel sector is estimated at 0.34 Gt worldwide,

8.  Cement sector emissions in this section are energy-related and do not include process emissions.
9.  These ﬁ gures exclude petrochemical feedstock, which is included in non-energy use in IEA energy bal-
ances. 
10.  The deﬁ nition of industry energy consumption and CO
2
 emissions used in IEA work on energy indica-
tors differs from that in the World Energy Outlook, which is based on IEA energy balances. The potentials 
include opportunites relating to process emissions, as well as coke ovens and blast furnaces for iron and 
steel.

or 300 kg of CO
2
 per tonne of steel produced, with the potential varying from 700 kg  in 
Ukraine to 70 kg in Japan, where the process is already efficient. The potential global 
reduction in the cement sector is estimated at 0.45 Gt, or 180 kg of CO
2
 per tonne 
of  cement, ranging from 390 kg in Russia to 60 kg in Japan. In some sectors, the CO
2
 
intensity of Other Major Economies and Other Countries is lower than that of OECD+ 
countries. For example, in the cement industry, new and therefore relatively modern 
plants  are  usually  located  in  Other  Major  Economies  and  Other  Countries,  where 
demand  has  expanded  in  recent  years  in  accordance  with  domestic  infrastructure 
development. As a result, the potential for further reductions in those countries is 
smaller than in some OECD+ countries. 
The iron and steel and cement sectors are assumed in the 550 Policy Scenario to 
reduce  their  CO
2
  intensity  by  at  least  as  much  as  the  best-available  technology 
permits  by  2020  in  OECD+  and  by  2030  in  Other  Major  Economies.  The  intensity 
improvement  from  2006  is  similar  for  both  regions,  but  the  difference  from  the 
Reference  Scenario  is  larger  for  Other  Major  Economies.  On  average,  the  CO
2
 
intensity of the iron and steel sector in OECD+ countries is already 25% lower in 2030 
in the Reference Scenario and is 32% lower in the 550 Policy Scenario, while that in 
Other Major Economies declines 18% in the Reference Scenario and 31% in the 550 
Policy Scenario (Figure 18.12).

Considering  the  age  profile  of  capital  stock  in  the  iron  and  steel  and  cement 
sectors in Other Major Economies, there is a need in the 550 Policy Scenario to 
introduce new production capacities that are substantially more efficient than the 
current average or to retrofit existing capacities (Box 18.2). Technology diffusion 
from  OECD+  and  effective  financial  mechanisms  are  needed  for  this  to  happen 
(see Chapter 19).

Box 18.2 z  Vintages of capital stock in iron and steel and cement sectors
The vintages of capital stocks in the iron and steel and cement sectors allow us 
to describe the opportunities for and limits to emissions reduction related to 
the building of new capacity in these two sectors. 11  In 2010, production capacity 
less than 10 years old, which will be used until the end of the projection period, 
accounts for 59% of total capacity in the iron and steel sector and 68% in the 
cement sector.
In  2030  in  the  Reference  Scenario,  54%  of  world  emissions  in  the  iron  and 
steel  and  non-metallic  minerals  (including  cement)  sectors  is  emitted  from 
production capacity built before 2010 (Figure 18.13). Most of this capacity exists 
in Other Major Economies and Other Countries, where the demand for cement is 
expanding. This underlines the urgent need for action to prevent more capacity 
being built using inefficient technologies, in particular in Other Major Economies 
and Other Countries; and it indicates the scope for emissions reduction from 
retrofitting existing capacity.

Transport 
In the 550 Policy Scenario, CO
2
 emissions from transport grow 27% from 2006, reaching 
8.2 Gt in 2030 (Table 18.9). Transport accounts for one-third of the global increase in 
emissions from energy-related sources in this scenario. Within the transport sector, 
road transport accounts for 81% of the CO
2
 emissions savings relative to the Reference 
Scenario in 2030 (0.6 Gt). Road transport accounts for 8% of energy-related emissions 
from all sources. Aviation (domestic and international) amounts to about 13% (0.1 Gt) 
of the transport emissions reduction in 2030, relative to the Reference Scenario.
11.  Due to a lack of historical data, we only assess new capacity to be built between 2002 and 2010 to meet 
increasing demand, and not that built to replace ageing plant stock.

 emissions from international aviation have been added to aviation at the World level. Aviation

The production of motor vehicles and aircrafts is characterised by high concentration, 
significant international exposure and homogeneity of the technology used. Around 50% 
of motor vehicle production is dominated by five multinational automakers — Toyota, 
General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler (WRI, 2007). As for aircraft, 
Boeing  Corporation  and Airbus  S.A.S  manufacture  almost  all  large  commercial  jet 
aircraft, while several manufactures produce the bulk of smaller aircraft. Virtually 
all manufacturers have assembly and production facilities in several countries. From 
a technology viewpoint, virtually all motor vehicles use internal combustion engines 
fuelled by gasoline, diesel, CNG, LPG, biofuels or newer hybrid technologies, while 
aviation technology is also broadly the same across the industry. The dominance of 
a  few  producing  companies  and  the  similarity  of  technologies  used  suggest  that  if 
common standards could be agreed upon, they would likely have global effects. 
In both climate-policy scenarios, international sectoral agreements in road transport 
and aviation are assumed to be adopted. Average fuel economy and CO

size, the performance efficiency and the fuel mix. The 550 Policy Scenario assumes 
a sectoral agreement on the production of new LDVs that leads to a global average 
fleet efficiency in 2030 of 120 grammes of CO
2
 per kilometre (gCO
2
/km), a reduction 
of 12% from the Reference Scenario, while allowing some flexibility based on regional 
circumstances. We assume that OECD+ countries with the most efficient fleets today, 
in Europe and Japan, set the highest standard, reaching an average fleet efficiency
of  106 gCO
2
/km  in  2030  —  an  improvement  of  34%  over  current  fleet  efficiency 
(Figure 18.14). The less efficient OECD+ countries see improvements of almost 40%, 
but reach a fleet average of only 130 gCO
2
/km in 2030, due mainly to the practice in 
the United States, Canada and Australia of buying larger and more powerful vehicles. 
In Other Major Economies, average fuel economy is currently close to the average 
OECD+ level and follows a similar rate of improvement over the projection period. 
The standard for Other Countries is less stringent, reaching 135 gCO
2
/km in 2030.

The incremental technology improvements that allow the average efficiency of the LDV 
fleet to reach these targets are also assumed to be introduced into the heavy-duty vehicle 
(HDV) fleet as fuel costs are a higher priority in the purchasing decision. This economic 
motivation is expected to draw more fuel-efficient technologies through to the HDV fleet 
even in the absence of international sectoral agreements. The fact that many vehicle 
manufactures produce both LDVs and HDVs will speed up technology diffusion. The 
global HDV fleet improves from nearly 840 gCO

2030, a 33% improvement, reflecting significant savings from the level in 2030 in the

Aviation has been the fastest-growing transport mode in recent years. The increase 
in oil prices and, to a lesser extent, the recent discussion of inclusion of aviation in 
emissions trading schemes, notably in Europe, is having a profound effect on airline

companies. Some airlines with older, less-efficient planes have become uncompetitive 
and been forced out of the market. Economic incentives to produce and deploy efficient 
aircraft are high. In the 550 Policy Scenario, we have assumed that an international 
agreement is reached between aircraft manufacturers to improve the efficiency of new 
planes by around 20% by 2020 and around 30% by 2030, compared with 2006 levels. For 
large planes (above 100 seats) the current fleet efficiency is 4.8 litres/100 revenue 
passenger  kilometres. 12 The  figure  for  the  new  Airbus  380  is  3 litres/100  rpk.  The 
550 Policy  Scenario  would  mean  that  by  2030  around  80%  of  revenue  passenger 
kilometres will be flown in planes attaining that level of efficiency. As a result, aviation 
oil consumption falls by 17 Mtoe in 2020 and 32 Mtoe in 2030, compared with the 
Reference Scenario. CO
2
 emissions are reduced by 52 Mt in 2020 and 96 Mt in 2030. 13
In the 550 Policy Scenario, CO
2
 emissions from aviation rise to 1 Gt in 2030, 43% higher 
than current levels. As a result, the share of aviation in energy-related CO
2
 emissions in 
transport grows to 13%, compared with the current level of 11%. 
Buildings and other sectors 14
Worldwide, direct emissions from fossil-fuel consumption (mainly for heating) in the 
residential, services and agriculture sector (called here “buildings and other sectors”) 
grow at 0.2% per year on average between 2006 and 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario, 
compared with a 0.8% growth rate in the Reference Scenario. If we attribute the CO
2
 
emissions from upstream power generation to this sector as a whole, according to its 
electricity use, CO
2
 emissions at world level grow by 0.4% per year from 2006 to reach 
9 Gt in 2030 (compared with 12 Gt in the Reference Scenario), accounting for 17% of 
the total increase in emissions to 2030. The residential sector accounts for 54% of the 
cumulative emissions reduction.
The biggest reduction in emissions occurs in OECD+ countries (Figure 18.15), where 
direct and indirect CO
2
 emissions taken together are projected to decline from 4.6 Gt 
in 2006 to 3.5 Gt in 2030, 1.5 Gt less than in the Reference Scenario. The 550 Policy 
Scenario sees Other Major Economies emissions growing throughout the Outlook period, 
to reach 4.2 Gt in 2030 — 1.1 Gt less than in the Reference Scenario. Total emissions 
from Other Countries grow at 0.9% per year between 2006 and 2030, compared with a 
growth rate in the Reference Scenario of 1.6%. This is 0.26 Gt less in 2030 than in the 
Reference Scenario.

is more complicated. The IPCC estimates that the total climate impact of aviation is two to four times 
greater than the impact of its CO

of policy instruments is limited to those applying to residential and commercial buildings and the energy-
consuming equipment and appliances therein.

The biggest saving comes from electricity. Total indirect CO
2
 emissions from electricity 
consumption in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario are 2.4 Gt lower than in the Reference 
Scenario.  Direct  emissions  from  fossil-fuel  consumption  are  0.47 Gt,  or  12%,  less 
than in the Reference Scenario. The reduction in indirect emissions from electricity 
consumption is due to the slow-down in electricity demand in the 550 Policy Scenario: 
world electricity demand in this scenario grows at 2.0% per year between 2006 and 
2030, 0.4 percentage points less than in the Reference Scenario. This produces savings 
of over 1 200 TWh of electricity in 2030, equivalent to 315 GW of installed natural gas 
combined–cycle gas-turbine capacity.

At the world level, the buildings and other sectors account for more than 35% of final 
energy savings in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario. The residential sector accounts for 
74% of that. In OECD+, most of the energy savings in the 550 Policy Scenario arise 
from better-insulated and designed buildings, which create lower heating and cooling 
energy demand. Among fossil fuels, the biggest savings are from gas, which is partly 
substituted by solar and biomass for space and water heating. Electricity provides the 
largest savings in Other Major Economies, based on policies on efficient appliances 
and air-conditioning standards. In Other Countries, the continuing trend away from 
the use of traditional biomass for cooking and heating is a major influence.
Both  policy  scenarios  assume  the  full  implementation  of  the  policies  now  under 
consideration in all countries. These include policies on lighting, electric appliances, 
space heating, water heating, cooking and air conditioning, in both the residential 
and  service  sectors.  In  OECD+  countries,  equipment  standards,  building  codes, 
building energy certification and voluntary measures are taken into account in the 
550 Policy Scenario. In some cases, mandatory labelling schemes are also assumed.

466 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Other Major Economies are assumed to adopt a range of measures to improve the 
energy  efficiency  of  new  equipment  and  buildings,  achieving  efficiencies  that 
gradually approach those of the OECD.
The OECD+ group of countries, with a total cumulative saving between 2006 and 2030 
of nearly 900 Mtoe, accounts for 24% of world cumulative energy savings in the sector. 
Better insulation in OECD+ countries can reduce the total amount of energy required 
for space heating and cooling by a factor of between two and four (IEA, 2008a). Also, 
the introduction of cap-and-trade in power generation has an impact on electricity 
prices, which rise 14% in the buildings sector, compared with the Reference Scenario, 
encouraging savings measures in general, including replacement of old, less efficient, 
appliances.  The  higher  electricity  prices  in  the  two  Policy  Scenarios  create  an 
incentive in several OECD+ countries for greater uptake of solar installations, mainly 
for water heating. 
Demand  for  fossil  fuels  in  OECD+  buildings  in  2030  is  13%  lower  in  the  550  Policy 
Scenario than in the Reference Scenario and electricity consumption is reduced by 
5.7%. The biggest saving is in gas consumption, with consumption down, relative to the 
Reference Scenario, by 48 Mtoe in the residential sector and 27 Mtoe in the services 
sector. Part of this gas saving arises from energy substitution — the 550 Policy Scenario 
contains an additional 22 Mtoe of solar energy for heating in 2030 in the residential 
sector and 9 Mtoe in services.
The  biggest  energy  saving  in  the  sector  will  come  from  Other  Major  Economies 
(Table 18.10). It will account for 55% of world energy savings in residential, services 
and  agricultural  use  in  2030.  Electricity  accounts  for  the  biggest  share  of  the 
savings. In Other Major Economies, more efficient household appliances and air 
conditioning cut residential electricity use by 30 Mtoe in 2030 and services use by 
12 Mtoe. 
The  most  important  measures  in  Other  Major  Economies  are  those  aimed  at 
encouraging energy efficiency in new buildings. The assumed introduction of building 
codes  with  specific  minimum  energy-performance  requirements  has  a  significant 
impact  in  this  region  because  the  total  built  floor  area  is  projected  to  double 
between 2006 and 2030. Building standards in Other Major Economies reach today’s 
OECD levels in 2030, and as a result residential energy consumption is reduced by 
135 Mtoe in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario compared with the Reference Scenario. 
In Other Countries, energy savings in buildings in the 550 Policy Scenario account for 
75 Mtoe in 2030, 65% of which comes from reduced consumption of traditional biomass 
for cooking and heating. Consumption of traditional biomass is 49 Mtoe lower in 2030, 
compared with the Reference Scenario, declining slightly over the  Outlook period, 
whereas in the Reference Scenario it grows at 0.5% per year on average. In both Policy 
Scenarios, the reduction in the use of biomass as a domestic fuel is more pronounced, 
thanks to additional policies and measures such as promotion of improved cookstoves 
in India. These interventions make biomass use more efficient, thus reducing the total 
volume consumed.

The much higher rate of decarbonisation of the power sector is mostly due to the 
enlargement of the cap-and-trade regime to include Other Major Economies, resulting 
in a faster and more efficient deployment of low-carbon technologies. The cap-and-
trade  regime  and  the  resulting  carbon  price  fosters  investment  in  cleaner  power 
generation technologies and facilitates capital and technology transfers from OECD+ 
countries to Other Major Economies. 
The faster uptake of low-carbon technologies facilitated by the cap-and-trade regime 
in OECD and Other Major Economies is also beneficial to Other Countries, which benefit 
from the accelerated learning resulting from faster deployment of renewables and 
nuclear, and reap benefits from investment by OECD+ in research and development 
programmes on promising technologies, such as CCS.

World  electricity  generation  in  2030  falls  by  around  4%  relative  to  the  550  Policy 
Scenario (Table 18.11), thanks to large energy efficiency gains, partly counterbalanced 
by the off-take of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in the transport sector, which 
increases transport electricity demand by 50 Mtoe in 2030 compared to the 550 Policy 
Scenario. At the global level, the power generation mix changes as follows: 
In 2030, electricity production from conventional coal and gas plants decreases by   
41% compared to the 550 Policy Scenario.
This fall is partly replaced by electricity produced by thermal plants with CCS. CCS   
capacity increases to 363 GW, 9% of fossil fuel-based power capacity worldwide. 
Thermal  plants  with  CCS  produce  8%  of  total  electricity  generation  in  2030 
(Figure 18.17).
Nuclear power capacity reaches nearly 680 GW in 2030 and supplies over 5 200 TWh,   
18% of total electricity generation.
Hydropower  and  the  rest  of  renewables  achieve  faster  deployment,  resulting  in   
production approaching 12 000 TWh in 2030, representing 40% of the total electricity 
generation  in  2030  and  more  than  half  the  additional  low-carbon  electricity, 
compared with the 550 Policy Scenario.

As a result of the assumed tighter emissions cap in OECD+, the carbon price faced by 
the power sector over 2020-2030 is higher than in the 550 Policy Scenario over the same 
period. This price, which reaches $180 per tonne of CO
2
 by 2030 makes renewables, 
nuclear  and  CCS  technologies  more  competitive  against  basic  fossil-fuel  electricity 
generation and favours faster deployment of these technologies. Economic incentives 
are assumed to be supplemented by tighter regulatory requirements, leading to the 
progressive phase-out of coal and oil plants in OECD+ countries over the 2020-2030 
decade in a process involving a faster rate of capital turnover. Flexibility in the design

470 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
of these phase-out policies and arrangements to permit the recovery of stranded asset 
investments are particularly important to the efficiency and cost of these policies. All 
new fossil-fuel plants built in the OECD+ in the 450 Policy Scenario after 2020 are fitted 
with CCS (Figure 18.18). The increase of nuclear power generation, relative to the 550 
Policy Scenario, is led by OECD+, which accounts for 58% of the increase worldwide to 
2030.

In the Other Major Economies, the introduction of cap-and-trade emissions regimes 
gives  rise  to  a  carbon  price  which  provides  a  financial  incentive  to  reinforce  the 
national policies and measures favouring low-carbon technologies which are already 
taken into account in the 550 Policy Scenario. In 2030, about 40% of the renewable 
electricity generation in the world is in Other Major Economies and about 32% of their 
new fossil-fuel plants after 2020 are equipped with CCS. In Other Major Economies and 
in Other Countries, faster technological deployment of cleaner coal technologies leads 
to an increase in the average efficiency of coal power plants (without CCS) due to the 
penetration of more efficient ultrasupercritical and integrated gasification combined-
cycle plants (Figure 18.19).
In Other Countries, CCS power generation barely kicks in. The share of renewables, 
however, does increase, thanks to faster cost reductions associated with the learning 
experience  arising  from  wider  deployment  in  other  regions.  Hydropower  and 
renewables, including biomass, supply 39% and 20% respectively of electricity in Other 
Countries. 
In the 450 Policy Scenario, CO
2
-intensive capacity is replaced by more efficient plants 
on a wider scale than in the Reference Scenario (Table 18.12). Coal-fired plants in use 
today are wholly replaced with CCS coal plants, whose capacity is increased by 127 GW, 
compared to the 550 Policy Scenario. 60 GW of additional capacity in gas-fired plants 
with CCS is installed by 2030, almost half of newly constructed CCS power plants. The 
322 GW increase in hydro capacity, together with additional capacity in onshore wind

and solar of 248 GW and 137 GW respectively, accounts for the bulk of low-carbon 
capacity additions in Other Countries. The sizeable nuclear capacity expansion taking 
place in OECD+ and Other Major Economies amounts to 140 GW, more than doubling the 
rate of build-up in the 550 Policy Scenario compared to the Reference Scenario.

472 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Industry
In  the  450  Policy  Scenario,  the  industry  sector  in  OECD+  faces  a  much  higher  CO
2 
price after 2020 than in the 550 Policy Scenario. Energy-related CO
2
 emissions from 
the industry sector in Other Major Economies are also limited by a carbon price, due 
to the cap-and-trade system introduced after 2020. Other Countries are assumed to 
implement the same national policies and measures as in the 550 Policy Scenario, but 
they benefit from the faster deployment of technology worldwide in the 450 Policy 
Scenario.
Global fossil fuel demand from the industry sector reaches 1 351 Mtoe in 2030, which 
is 247 Mtoe or 15% lower than in the 550 Policy Scenario. 15  The difference relative to 
the Reference Scenario reaches 476 Mtoe. OECD+ demand declines over the projection 
period, while that of Other Major Economies and Other Countries grows, albeit at a 
much slower rate than in the Reference Scenario and 550 Policy Scenario.
Global industry CO
2
 emissions reach 4.3 Gt in 2030 — 1.3 Gt, or 23%, lower than in the 
550 Policy Scenario.   The total reduction compared with the Reference Scenario reaches 
2.2 Gt by 2030. Most of the reduction comes from OECD+ and Other Major Economies. 
The  reduction  compared  with  the  550  Policy  Scenario  in  Other  Major  Economies 
reaches 0.9 Gt and that in OECD+ reaches 0.3 Gt. Efficiency improvements and fuel 
switching account for the most of the reduction in Other Major Economies, while CCS 
plays a major role in OECD+. Amongst the fossil fuels, emissions from coal combustion 
decline most — by 27% compared with the 550 Policy Scenario. The iron and steel sector 
reduces emissions most in absolute terms, relative to the 550 Policy Scenario, followed 
by the non-metallic minerals and the chemicals and petrochemicals sectors.
In the 450 Policy Scenario, industry sector CO
2
 intensity (CO
2
 per unit of GDP) is one-
third  lower  worldwide  by  2030  compared  with  the  Reference  Scenario,  and  is  cut 
by around 60% in Other Major Economies, requiring a significant increase in energy 
efficiency and the deployment of new technologies in the production process. Huge 
efficiency improvements in existing facilities, through retrofitting or replacement, are 
required in both OECD+ and Other Major Economies, and could prove very costly. 
Major technological breakthroughs, such as CCS, are needed in the 450 Policy Scenario. 
CCS is assumed to be introduced in the industry sector towards the end of the Outlook 
period, mainly in OECD+ regions. Relatively large potential for CCS implementation 
exists in blast furnaces in iron and steel production and in cement kilns. By 2030, CCS 
reduces emissions in the industry sector by 0.3 Gt, accounting for 15% of the total 
reduction compared with the Reference Scenario. Though CCS is assumed to be one of 
the key technologies adopted to reduce emissions in the industry sector, the realisation 
of this expectation depends, among other things, on the development of legal and 
regulatory  frameworks,  and  further  research  and  development  to  reduce  capture, 
transport and storage costs and improve system efficiency (IEA, 2008a).

Transport
Further CO
2
 savings in the transport sector are achieved in OECD+ and Other Major 
Economies  in  the  450  Policy  Scenario  through  the  strengthening  of  international 
transport-sector  agreements.  Faster  deployment  of  new  technology  benefits  all 
countries,  bringing  the  sector’s  CO
2
  emissions  in  2030  to  7.8 Gt.  This  represents  a 
saving of 0.4 Gt relative to the 550 Policy Scenario, and total savings of 1.1 Gt over the 
Reference Scenario. However, the introduction of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids 
increases  electricity  consumption  in  the  transport  sector,  which  means  that  some 
of the savings in the transport sector are offset by increased emissions from power 
generation. 
Average global CO
2
 emissions per kilometre from the LDV fleet are reduced by a quarter 
from those of the Reference Scenario in 2030. This is achieved by means of further 
penetration  of  hybrids,  increased  consumption  of  biofuels  and  the  introduction  of 
electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. The average fleet efficiency in OECD+ in 2030 
is 90 gCO
2
/km, a 49% reduction from today’s levels or 32% down on the Reference 
Scenario. In Other Major Economies, the average efficiency will reach 110 gCO
2
/km 
by 2030, an improvement of 18% over the Reference Scenario and 38% below today’s 
levels.  Stringent  sectoral  agreements  induce  faster  technological  development  and 
deployment in the global LDV sector. As a result, efficiency in Other Countries also 
improves, to 122 gCO
2
/km in 2030, an improvement of 17% compared to the Reference 
Scenario in 2030 and 36% below today’s levels. 
Larger average vehicle size and the long-established consumer preference for power 
over fuel economy in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand opens up 
potential for greater savings in these areas. Smaller vehicle sizes on average mean 
that  the  current  vehicle  fleet  in  Other  Major  Economies  is  less  carbon-intensive 
per kilometre than that in the OECD+ today. However, this also means their savings 
potential is lower. 
Plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles make rapid inroads into global new vehicle sales 
by 2030, increasing their share of the vehicle fleet in 2030, relative to the Reference 
Scenario. A further increase in biofuels consumption is also required. Biofuels demand 
increases to over 240 Mtoe in 2030 in the 450 Policy Scenario. This is 40% more than 
in the 550 Policy Scenario, a doubling compared with the Reference Scenario and an 
almost 10-fold increase from today’s level. The majority of the increase is met by 
second-generation biofuels, which need to be introduced earlier than envisaged in the 
Reference Scenario and require a significant increase in global production between 
2020 and 2030. The penetration of electric vehicles and biofuels, as well as bigger 
savings in aviation fuels compared with the Reference Scenario, mean the increase in 
oil consumption is lower in the 450 Policy Scenario, from around 2 100 Mtoe in 2006 
to around 2 500 Mtoe in 2020 and in 2030. Globally, transport oil demand rises slowly 
through to 2020 and then levels out through to 2030, in contrast to the continuing 
increase seen in the Reference Scenario. Oil use in transportation in OECD+ drops to 
around 1995 levels by 2030, while that in Other Major Economies and Other Countries 
is projected to increase steadily through the projection period, by 3.3% and 1.4% per 
year respectively.
© OECD/IEA, 2008
474 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Savings  of  over  370 Mtoe  of  oil  are  achieved  in  2030  compared  to  the  Reference 
Scenario, slightly more than the current use of oil in transportation in the European 
Union. Savings from LDVs amount to nearly 200 Mtoe, a reduction of 21% compared to 
the Reference Scenario in 2030. Around a further 130 Mtoe is saved in the HDV fleet 
by 2030, a reduction of 11%. OECD+ provides 61% of total oil savings, Other Major 
Economies 27% and the remainder comes from Other Countries. 
The ambitious CO
2
 reductions in the transport sector in the 450 Policy Scenario can not 
be achieved without significant global penetration of much more efficient vehicles, 
full electric vehicles or vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells, supported by the 
associated capital investment in infrastructure (see Spotlight in Chapter 3). As in the 
550 Policy Scenario, sectoral agreements are not assumed to apply to the HDV fleet 
in this scenario. Savings in fuel and CO
2
 emissions from greater efficiency in the road 
fleet can be achieved at a lower cost than further improvements in aviation efficiency 
or the introduction of second-generation biofuels suitable for aviation. Therefore, the 
aviation sector follows the same emissions trajectory as the 550 Policy Scenario.
Buildings and other sectors
In the 450 Policy Scenario, the introduction of cap-and-trade in Other Major Economies 
and the more stringent cap for OECD+ will increase the price of electricity in 2030 by 7% 
in Other Major Economies and by 25% in OECD+, compared with the Reference Scenario. 
This encourages more significant savings in the residential, services and agriculture 
sector (called here the “buildings and other sectors”) than in the 550 Policy Scenario, 
with a total reduction in electricity consumption worldwide in excess of 1 850 TWh in 
2030 compared to the Reference Scenario. OECD+ and Other Major Economies will each 
save more than 800 TWh of electricity in 2030. 
To achieve these savings a wide range of improvements in the efficiency of appliances 
and  machinery  is  required,  including  a  worldwide  switch  from  less-efficient 
incandescent lamps to compact fluorescent lamps for lighting, a massive shift to best-
available technologies for appliances, large-scale penetration of solar power for water 
and space heating, and a substantial share of low-energy or low-carbon buildings in new 
building in the OECD+. 
The higher electricity price in the 450 Policy Scenario creates an incentive in OECD+ and 
Other Major Economies for greater uptake of renewable heating installations, mainly 
for water heating. As a result, renewable (excluding biomass) energy consumption in 
2030 rises more than 100 Mtoe higher than in the Reference Scenario. In the 450 Policy 
Scenario, the share of renewables and modern biomass in total energy consumption in 
the sector is 13% in 2030, seven percentage points more than in the Reference Scenario 
and nine percentage points more than in 2006.
The reduction in electricity consumption will reduce the associated CO
2
 emissions in 
this sector by 4.5 Gt in 2030, compared with the Reference Scenario. Additional fossil-
fuel savings compared to the 550 Policy Scenario amount to 14%, yielding savings over 
and above the Reference Scenario in direct CO
2
 emissions from fossil fuel consumption 
of 0.9 Gt in 2030. The biggest savings in CO
2
 emissions will occur in OECD+, where

18
direct and indirect CO
2
 emissions in the sector, at 2.5 Gt, will be 46% lower in 2030 
than in 2006. They are 1 Gt less than in the 550 Policy Scenario and 2.6 Gt less than in 
the Reference Scenario.
Co-benefits in the 550 and 450 Policy Scenarios
Energy security
The  measures  taken  to  contain  CO
2
  emissions  under  both  policy  scenarios  have 
substantial implications for the energy security of consuming regions. OECD+ oil and 
gas imports in 2030 in the 550 Policy Scenario are some 260 Mtoe, or 15%, lower than 
the Reference Scenario (Figure 18.20). The oil and gas import savings expand to over 
400 Mtoe if China and India are added. OECD+ oil and gas import dependence in 2030 
falls from 48% in the Reference Scenario to 44% in the 550 Policy Scenario, which is even 
lower than in 2006. With lower imports and international fuel prices in 2030, the net 
oil and gas import bill of OECD+ is reduced by nearly $450 billion, or 31%, compared 
with the Reference Scenario. The proportion of OECD+ GDP represented by the fuel bill 
increases from 1.9% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2030 in the Reference Scenario, while it declines 
to 1.6% in the 550 Policy Scenario, making the economy less vulnerable to international 
fuel-price fluctuations.

The oil imports of OECD+ decline due to end-use efficiency improvements and switching 
away from oil, mainly in the transport sector. In 2030, OECD+ oil imports in the 550 
Policy Scenario reach around 19 mb/d, 4.5 mb/d or 19% lower than in the Reference 
Scenario, with import dependence falling from 53% to 47%. The reduction is more than 
Iran’s current oil production. However, despite the decline in global oil demand, there 
will still be a need for a substantial increase in OPEC production. Total OPEC production 
in the 550 Policy Scenario reaches just over 49 mb/d in 2030, almost 13 mb/d higher 
than today. Gas imports in the 550 Policy Scenario decline due to energy efficiency

improvements in buildings, but not by as much as oil imports because of fuel switching 
from coal to gas in power generation. OECD+ gas imports in 2030 decline by 8% to just 
over 700 bcm from 775 bcm in the Reference Scenario.  
In the 550 Policy Scenario, the security of electricity supply is also improved. Global 
electricity demand in 2030 declines by 223 Mtoe, or 9%, relative to the Reference 
Scenario, which reduces the urgency of investment to construct or upgrade power-
generation plant and distribution networks. Lowered electricity intensity improves the 
resilience of countries’ economies to potential power-supply disruptions. The fuel mix 
is more diversified. The combined share of the two dominant power-generation fuels, 
coal and gas, is reduced from 71% to 61% worldwide in 2030. The power sector depends 
less on imported fossil fuels with the increased uptake of nuclear and renewables.
In the 450 Policy Scenario, energy demand of OECD+ falls below its current level and 
consuming regions need to import less fuel than in the 550 Policy Scenario. Imports 
of oil and gas in OECD+ decline by 3% in 2030 from the 550 Policy Scenario and 5% if 
China and India are included. OPEC oil production is projected to reach 48 mb/d in 
2030, some 5 mb/d lower than projected in the Reference Scenario (but still 12 mb/d 
higher than today’s production level). Due to the significant change in the power-
generation fuel mix, the reduction in gas imports of OECD+ in 2030 from the 550 Policy 
Scenario reaches over 60 bcm, or 9%, which would significantly contribute to the gas 
supply security of the region. Also, OECD+ needs to spend $17 billion less for oil and 
gas imports in the 450 Policy Scenario compared with the 550 Policy Scenario.  
Although the reduction in global electricity demand in 2030 is only 4% compared with 
the 550 Policy Scenario, the fuel mix changes significantly as a result of the wider use 
of nuclear and renewables. The share of coal and gas as fuel for power and heat plants 
in the 450 Policy Scenario in 2030 declines to 47%. This contributes to the security of 
the electricity sector, making the sector in many countries less import-dependent.  
Local and regional air pollution
Lower  fossil-fuel  demand  in  the  two  climate-policy  scenarios  results  in  substantial 
environmental co-benefits in the form of reduced local air pollution. For all pollutants, 
the biggest reductions occur in the last decade of the projection period, as this is when 
policies to reduce demand and to enforce stricter regulations on CO
2
 emissions have 
the greatest impact. 
In the 550 Policy Scenario, the world’s NO
x
 emissions are projected to decline from 
80 million tonnes in 2005 to 70 Mt in 2030, 11% lower than in the Reference Scenario. 
Fuel substitution and lower fuel use in the power sector accounts for around 60% of 
the overall global reduction. The transport sector accounts for 20% of the reduction. 
Emissions of SO
2
 also decline, from 89 Mt in 2005 to 73 Mt in 2030, or 18% lower than 
in the Reference Scenario. The power sector accounts for more than 70% of the overall 
global reduction in SO
2
 emissions in 2030. Particulate matter emissions decline fast over 
the Outlook period — from 37 Mt in 2005 to 26 Mt in 2030, compared with 28 Mt in 2030 
in the Reference Scenario.

CHAPTER 19
IMPLICATIONS FOR ENERGY INVESTMENT 
What does transformation entail?
The climate-policy scenarios require a substantial shift in investment patterns   z
and a major transformation of the way investment decisions in the energy sector 
are taken. In both scenarios, significant additional investment is needed in power 
plants and in more energy-efficient energy-related capital stock.
The 550 Policy Scenario requires additional investment of $1.2 trillion in power   z
plants and $3 trillion in energy efficiency relative to the Reference Scenario. 
Most of this investment goes to deploying existing technologies. In the power-
generation sector, investment over the period 2010-2030 rises from $6.1 trillion 
in the Reference Scenario to $7.3 trillion in the 550 Policy Scenario, bringing forth 
more renewables, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. Two-thirds of 
the additional investment occurs in the OECD+ region. Of the additional $3 trillion 
of investment in energy efficiency, around half is in transport; buildings need an 
additional $950 billion and industry close to $530 billion. The total additional 
global investment (relative to the Reference Scenario) equates to 0.24 % of world 
GDP per year on average over the period 2010-2030. The savings on energy bills 
between 2010 and 2030 total over $7 trillion. 
The 450 Policy Scenario requires further power plant investments of $2.4 trillion   z
(in addition to those in the 550 Policy Scenario), over half of which are in the 
Other  Major  Economies  group.  This  scenario  assumes  broad  deployment  of 
technologies that have not yet been proven. Research and development now 
will  determine  whether  these  advanced  technologies  will  be  available  in  the 
future.  These  investments  result  from  a  broad,  efficient  carbon  market  and 
global deployment of the best technologies. Investment in energy efficiency also 
rises considerably after 2020. During that period, improving energy efficiency in 
buildings sees the highest investment. Additional investments in total amount to 
0.55% of world GDP. Fuel-cost savings are about $5.8 trillion.
In  both  scenarios,  the  policy  effort  to  galvanise  energy-efficient  purchases   z
by hundreds of millions of households and businesses worldwide is enormous, 
involving strong price signals, fiscal incentives and well-targeted regulation. In 
the 550 Policy Scenario, the additional annual expenditure by individuals averages 
$17 per person. The level is highest in OECD+, at $54 per person per year. In
the OECD+ region, this amount is almost $150 over the period 2021-2030 in the 450 
Policy Scenario, and is almost 80% higher than that of the 550 Policy Scenario.
Auctioning  of  emissions  allowances  could  raise  substantial  funds,  to  help  fund   z
investments and research, or reduce national economic taxes. In both scenarios, 
revenues from full auctioning exceed the total additional global investment needed.

480 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
The investment challenge of transforming energy
The profound shifts in energy demand and supply in the two climate scenarios call for 
a transformation of the way investment decisions are taken. They entail significant 
changes in the pattern of investment across the supply and demand chains, as well as 
huge additional spending on new capital stock, especially in power plants and in more 
energy-efficient equipment and appliances — the focus of this chapter.
To  achieve  the  required  shifts  in  the  power  sector  and  improvements  in  energy 
efficiency, investment and purchasing decisions 1  must change. An important role for 
governments is to catalyse these investments in a targeted manner. Clear price signals, 
including carbon pricing and, in many non-OECD countries, the removal of subsidised 
fuel prices, are an important first step. Current high energy prices, if sustained, will 
facilitate the transition. However, prices alone are not enough: effective government 
policies  to  promote  these  changes  are  needed,  including  information  provision, 
regulation, financing schemes and fiscal incentives. 
Investment implications of the 550 Policy Scenario
The  550  Policy  Scenario  envisages  additional  investment  in  power  plants,  where 
electricity production must be cleaner, in energy efficiency in industry, buildings 
and transport, where companies and households alike must invest in more efficient 
technologies,  and  in  biofuels,  where  more  biorefinery  capacity  needs  to  be  built 
(Figure 19.1). 2  
In the power-generation sector, where more low-carbon generating capacity is needed, 
investment over the period 2010-2030 rises from $6.1 trillion in the Reference Scenario 
to $7.3 trillion in the 550 Policy Scenario. Over this period, electricity demand is around 
5% lower than in the Reference Scenario. However, electricity prices are higher in the 
550 Policy Scenario than in the Reference Scenario, in order to provide an appropriate 
level of return on these investments.
On  the  demand  side  (industry,  transport  and  buildings),  additional  investment  of 
$3 trillion is needed, in order to use energy more efficiently. 3  Half of this investment, 
$1.5 trillion, is invested in transport; buildings need an additional $0.9 trillion and 
industry close to $0.5 trillion. Consumers need to purchase more efficient products, 
ranging from highly efficient electrical appliances to low-carbon passenger vehicles.
1. In this chapter, the term “investment” is used to refer to both capital spending by businesses and spending 
by households and individuals on cars, equipment, appliances and other energy-related expenditures.  
2. In the 550 Policy Scenario, the additional investment in biofuels is $54 billion.
3. The total additional investment in energy efﬁ ciency in the 550 Policy Scenario, relative to the Reference 
Scenario, is over 25% higher than additional investment in WEO-2007’s Alternative Policy Scenario (which 
follows  a  similar  emissions  trajectory  to  the  550  Policy  Scenario),  relative  to  WEO-2007’s  Reference 
Scenario. The unit costs of demand-side efﬁ ciency measures have been revised upwards, due to increasing 
commodity costs and a shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the OECD. This is only partially offset by 
efﬁ ciencies associated with the more widespread deployment of these measures assumed in this Outlook.

While  challenging,  the  550  Policy  Scenario  can  be  achieved  mainly  through  the 
deployment  of  existing  technologies,  or  incremental  improvements  to  these  (such 
as continued enhancement of the internal combustion engine in passenger vehicles). 
The  challenge  is  therefore  to  create  the  incentives  to  ensure  that  the  necessary 
investments are made. Globally, there is enough capital to finance these investment 
needs. The current financial crisis may take a toll on energy-related investments by 
making it more difficult to obtain credit or by making them more expensive, but this is 
unlikely significantly to affect the long-term outlook. Funding will have to come from 
both public and private sources. Securing funds for energy investment in poor countries 
will  be  much  more  challenging  than  in  OECD  countries;  additional  foreign  direct 
investment is likely to be essential. While availability of capital may not be an issue, 
the availability of engineering and manufacturing capacity and the supply of materials 
may create challenges. Such constraints may take a decade or so to extenuate.
Regional implications of the 550 Policy Scenario
There are significant variations in additional investment needs among groups in the 550 
Policy Scenario. The OECD+ group incurs by far the highest increases in investment in 
electricity generation and in efficiency (Figure 19.2). Other Major Economies undertake 
an additional $170 billion investment in power plants, 8% more than in the Reference 
Scenario,  but  face  a  more  substantial  increase  in  investment  in  energy  efficiency. 
Relative to the other groups of countries, the additional spending on power plants by 
the Other Major Economies group is small, reflecting large reductions in electricity 
demand  in  these  countries.  Investment  in  power  generation  in  Other  Countries  is 
nearly $140 billion greater than in the Reference Scenario, while investment in energy 
efficiency  increases  by  $430  billion.  The  additional  average  annual  investment  in 
power plants and efficiency is equal to 0.24 % of world GDP over the period 2010-2030.

In middle- and low-income countries, the power sector is most often a public utility 
requiring access to public funds to finance large investments to meet rapidly growing 
electricity demand. It is, therefore, good news that, compared with the Reference 
Scenario, total investment in the power sector — including generation, transmission 
and distribution — is 8% (almost half a trillion dollars) lower in Other Major Economies 
and 3% lower in Other Countries (Figure 19.3). This is due to lower investment in 
networks in the 550 Policy Scenario, as a result of lower electricity demand. This 
is particularly important in alleviating the burden of investment in those countries 
struggling to raise finance.

As  discussed  above,  the  greatest  challenge  is  to  encourage  private  consumers  to 
invest in energy efficiency by making their homes more energy-efficient — including 
the purchase of more efficient appliances — and by driving more efficient cars. The 
additional investment by individuals in the 550 Policy Scenario is estimated at $54 per 
person per year in the OECD+ region, at $11 per person per year in the Other Major 
Economies region and at $5 per person per year in Other Countries, corresponding to a 
global average of $17 per year (Figure 19.4).

Implications of the 550 Policy Scenario for the electricity sector
Globally, additional investment in power plants of nearly $1.2 trillion is needed, in the 
application of low-carbon technologies. Most of this investment ($0.8 trillion) occurs 
within  the  cap-and-trade  regime  in  the  OECD+  region,  with  investment  in  capital-
intensive technologies such as nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and 
renewables.  As  shown  in  Chapter  18,  the  carbon  price  driving  these  investments 
increases over time, rising to $40 per tonne of CO
2
 in 2020 and reaching $90 per tonne 
in 2030. 
Figure 19.5 shows projected power-generation costs in Europe and the United States 
for 2030 under CO
2
 prices of $50 and $90 per tonne. Onshore wind and nuclear power 
become much more competitive relative to conventional fossil-fuel technologies. Coal 
with CCS becomes commercial by 2030. This assumes that the pilot deployments in the 
OECD+ region are successful, that sustained learning brings down capital costs, and 
that efficiency losses are reduced.

The cap-and-trade system cannot eliminate all uncertainties. Investors still have to 
analyse the fundamental factors determining the cost of abating CO
2
 emissions in the 
future, in order to form CO
2
 price expectations upon which they can act. However, 
the energy sector is used to dealing with such market risks and an efficient carbon 
market,  with  an  array  of  financial  instruments,  will  help  the  sector  to  function 
efficiently.
It is uncertainty about climate policy that is one of the greatest risks with which 
investors  in  power  generation  are  currently  faced.  Climate  policy  will  have  a 
significant  impact  on  the  absolute  and  relative  costs  of  different  electricity 
generation options. This is, of course, intended, since the main thrust of climate 
policy is to alter the technology choices that investors make. However, uncertainty 
about future climate policy creates great uncertainty about future generating costs 
and the merits of different investment options. This is likely to lead to delays in 
investments  until  greater  policy  certainty  is  available.  The  sooner  policy  makers 
can make decisions on climate-change mitigation policies, the less risky investments 
in new power generation will be. Going forward, it will be important to minimise 
policy risk by providing a comprehensive, robust post-2012 framework, which instills 
confidence in the energy sector as to the direction of global policy for the foreseeable 
future, while yet preserving a modicum of flexibility to permit some modification in 
the light of experience.
Experiences from the first phase of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme 
(EU ETS) give good indications of how the implementation of a cap-and-trade system 
© OECD/IEA, 2008
Chapter 19 - Implications for energy investment  485
19
affects investments. In the first phase, the CO
2
 reductions required by the power 
sector to fulfill government commitments were mainly delivered through switching 
fuel  from  coal  to  gas  within  existing  installations.  Wind  power  also  expanded 
considerably.  At  the  same  time  considerable  plans  for  expansion  of  coal  plants 
emerged, as a response to high gas prices. In that sense, the EU ETS was claimed not 
to change investment patterns, but only to change the pattern of operating existing 
plants. 
Several  reasons  for  this  marginal  effect  have  been  highlighted.  First,  commitments 
on CO
2
 reductions covered only the period to 2012, which was seen as too short to 
incentivise profound cleaner investments. Second, free allowances for new projects and 
cancellation of initial allowances following decommissioning proved a counter-incentive 
to  factoring  the  implied  carbon  cost  into  decision-making  (Bouttes  et  al.,  2007).
With the EU agreement to proceed with the EU ETS beyond 2012 on the basis of full 
auctioning of emission rights for the power sector, a much stronger signal is sent to 
investors.  There  are  signs  that  these  signals  are  having  an  effect,  even  before  full 
agreement  on  the  legislation  has  been  reached:  several  planned  coal  plants  have 
been cancelled, while other, state-of-the-art coal plants are going ahead; investors 
are showing great interest in nuclear power in countries where this is not ruled out by 
government policy and are pushing the debate in countries where nuclear operation or 
expansion has thus far been excluded.
Implications of the 550 Policy Scenario for the transport sector
While transport is a difficult sector in which to reduce total emissions, due to rapidly 
growing global demand and a lack of cost-effective alternatives, there is considerable 
potential for abatement, relative to the Reference Scenario. In the 550 Policy Scenario, 
the  sectoral  agreements  in  road  transport  and  aviation,  and  national  policies  lead 
to  additional  investment  of  $1.5  trillion,  which  delivers  substantial  reductions  in 
fuel  consumption.  OECD+  countries  make  almost  70%  of  the  incremental  transport 
investment. This high share is a function of the higher cost of increasing fuel economy 
in some parts of the OECD and its larger share of vehicle sales over the projection 
period. 
The sectoral agreements bring forth a variety of technologies to deliver energy and 
CO
2
 savings. While some of the improvements to the internal combustion engine in the 
550 Policy Scenario will go to improved performance, most technology improvements 
benefit fuel efficiency. In addition, energy savings come from more rapid penetration 
of  hybrid  cars  and  light-weight  materials.  CO
2
  savings  are  also  made  by  increased 
consumption of biofuels.
The large abatement potential in road transport is in part explained by existing wide 
differences in the efficiency of vehicles, both across and within regions. For example, 
the average vehicle in the United States is currently around 40% less efficient than that 
in Japan (Figure 19.6). The sectoral approach we have modelled works to reduce this 
differential. Improving vehicle efficiency is cheaper in countries with a larger share of 
inefficient vehicles, especially heavy ones, in the existing fleet.

Even with a sectoral agreement in road transport, consumer investment choices will 
be particularly important in helping to realise the 550 Policy Scenario. Analysis of the 
sector in the United Kingdom shows that there is a large variance in new car efficiency 
even within the same class of vehicle, such that if consumers opted for the most CO
2
-
efficient vehicle in their chosen class, their average overall per-kilometre emissions 
would fall by around 25% (King, 2008). Downsizing would achieve further abatement. In 
the Other Major Economies region, where vehicle ownership is growing rapidly, these 
choices will be particularly important.
However,  evidence  suggests  that  consumers  tend  to  discount  heavily  the  claimed 
value of fuel savings from more efficient vehicles, such that direct government action 
to encourage low-carbon investments will continue to be important. On the consumer 
side, this may include improved information provision and fiscal incentives — such 
as  annual  or  up-front  vehicle  tax  rates  that  vary  according  to  a  vehicle’s  carbon 
efficiency. 4  On the producer side, international sectoral agreements may stimulate 
regulatory approaches, such as the proposed EU legislation on vehicle emissions.
While  substantial  abatement  can  be  achieved  by  adopting  existing  road  transport 
technologies,  there  is  also  great  potential  from  new  technologies  —  both  through 
enhancements  to  the  internal  combustion  engine  and,  increasingly,  hybridisation 
and electrification of vehicles. There has been a steady increase in the efficiency of 
new vehicles over recent years, and this can be accelerated by providing the right 
incentives to manufacturers to undertake research, development and demonstration  
and to bring more efficient models to market. 
4.  For example, France operates a “bonus-malus” scheme, where government imposes an up-front tax on 
high-emitting vehicles and a subsidy on low-emitting vehicles. Many countries differentiate vehicle excise 
duty according to vehicle emissions.

Large  financial  incentives  exist  in  the  aviation  industry  to  use  the  most  efficient 
aircraft, and the sectoral agreement in the 550 Policy Scenario (see Chapter 18) sees 
CO
2
  savings  coming  from  a  combination  of  improvements  in  jet  engine  efficiency, 
increased  load  factors,  improved  aerodynamics,  use  of  light-weight  materials  and 
improved air-traffic procedures on top of those in the Reference Scenario. 
Implications of the 550 Policy Scenario for buildings
and industry
In the 550 Policy Scenario, national policies and measures lead to additional spending 
of around $950 billion to achieve greater energy efficiency in buildings, about a third 
of the total additional investment in energy efficiency across all sectors. Most of this 
additional spending is on electrical equipment such as more efficient refrigerators, 
much of it by households. Two-thirds of the additional investment in energy efficiency 
in buildings is projected to be in the OECD+ region. This region achieves the highest 
savings in CO
2
 emissions (see Chapter 18).
Additional  investment  in  energy  efficiency  in  industry  is  projected  to  be  around
$530 billion. As discussed in Chapter 18, this includes the increased use of electric arc 
furnaces in the iron and steel sector and the wider deployment of large-scale rotary 
dry  kilns  in  the  cement  sector.  As  in  buildings,  more  than  half  of  these  industrial 
investments will be in OECD+, although investment in energy efficiency is generally 
more  cost-effective  in  Other  Major  Economies  and  Other  Countries  because  their 
equipment is less efficient than OECD+ and the capital costs of various technologies 
are lower.
Costs and benefits of the 550 Policy Scenario 
While the 550 Policy Scenario requires additional spending on energy efficiency and on 
power plants to address climate change, there are additional benefits to consumers on 
a global scale. These investments reduce consumption of fossil fuels by 22 billion tonnes 
of oil equivalent over the period 2010 to 2030. This delivers savings for individuals and 
business and reduces the burden of energy imports. The lower consumption of fossil 
fuels, particularly oil and gas, improves supply security. 
On a global scale, significant savings in consumer energy bills arise in the 550 Policy 
Scenario, relative to the Reference Scenario, due to more efficient energy use. Energy 
bills to pay for electricity, motor fuels and heating fuels are over $7 trillion lower than 
in the Reference Scenario, as a result of energy savings and lower fossil-fuel prices 
(Figure 19.7). The net undiscounted savings in the 550 Policy Scenario amount to over 
$4 trillion. 5  Discounted at a 3% rate, net savings are some $2.7 trillion. With a 10% 
discount rate, the net savings fall to around $1 trillion dollars. 6  The savings have been 
5.  Net of investment.
6.  Discount rates actually vary between sectors and regions; the two uniform rates used here should be 
seen as indicative only.

calculated  over  the  period  2010-2030.  For  some  types  of  investments,  particularly 
those made after 2020, savings will continue beyond 2030. These extra benefits have 
not been included in our analysis. Also, in some sectors — notably industry in the OECD+ 
region — emission reductions come at a cost. This sector participates in a cap-and-
trade scheme and pays for the CO
2
 it emits.

Given the available savings in energy bills in most sectors, consumers and businesses 
should already be incentivised to undertake these investments. However, energy 
efficiency is rarely the overriding criterion in the purchase of such goods. These 
demand-side  investments  involve  substantial  up-front  costs  and  experience 
shows  that  consumers  —  ranging  from  large  and  small  industries,  to  commercial 
establishments to transport companies — can be reluctant to depart from the least 
capital cost solution, even when a higher outlay pays for itself within a few years. 
They  typically  focus  on  the  up-front  costs  of  the  energy-consuming  goods  they 
purchase  and  tend  to  heavily  discount  the  full  lifecycle  costs,  including  energy 
usage, particularly when energy prices are low. The challenge may be even more 
significant in Other Countries, where additional demand-side investments constitute 
a  higher  proportion  of  household  income  and  where  there  are  fewer  resources 
available to achieve fully co-ordinated policies.
Investment implications of the 450 Policy Scenario
The  450  Policy  Scenario  requires  additional  investment  of  $3.6  trillion  in  power 
plants  and  $5.7  trillion  in  energy  efficiency  over  the  period  2010-2030  relative  to 
the  Reference  Scenario. 7   This  additional  investment  is  much  higher  in  the  period 
7.  Investment in biofuels in 2010-2030 is $127 billion higher than in the Reference Scenario.

19
2021-2030  than  in  the  period  2010-2020  (Figure  19.8).  In  the  450  Policy  Scenario, 
substantially  higher  investment  is  needed  in  power  plants.  Post-2020,  this  power 
sector investment is nearly twice as high as in the Reference Scenario. This is because 
substantial investments are needed to replace existing fossil-fuel based power plants. 
Similarly, investment in energy efficiency rises considerably in the 450 Policy Scenario, 
particularly beyond 2020. During that period, improving energy efficiency in buildings 
will require the highest investment. The cumulative saving on energy bills over the 
period 2010-2030 amount to $5.8 trillion — a lower sum than in the 550 Policy Scenario. 
The energy savings are bigger than in the 550 Policy Scenario, but electricity prices are 
higher.

Note: In the 550 Policy Scenario, additional investment in power plants in 2021-2030 is lower than in the 
period 2010-2020 because electricity demand is much lower in this period and consequently fewer new power 
plants are built. This changes in the 450 Policy Scenario because there is a greater degree of replacement of 
existing fossil-fuel based power plants to reduce CO
2
 emissions.
The 450 Policy Scenario requires substantial investments and abatement in non-OECD 
countries (Figure 19.9). Given the level of abatement needed, Other Major Economies 
are assumed to join the cap-and-trade system in 2020. Investment in power plants in 
this group is $1.4 trillion higher than in the Reference Scenario, slightly less than the 
extra $1.6 trillion needed in OECD+. Investment in energy efficiency is also substantially 
higher. In Other Countries, investment in power plants is over 80% higher than in the 
Reference Scenario.
Investment by private consumers must rise considerably after 2020. The average annual 
additional investment per person (to cover residential buildings, appliances and private 
cars) by region is shown in Figure 19.10. In the OECD+ region, this amount is almost 
$150 over the period 2021-2030 and is almost 80% higher than that of the 550 Policy 
Scenario.

In the 450 Policy Scenario, the additional investment in power plants and demand-side 
efficiency corresponds to 0.55% of cumulative world GDP over the period 2010-2030, 
compared with 0.24% in the 550 Policy Scenario. Many of the additional investments 
in  the  450  Policy  Scenario  are  in  power-sector  technologies  that  are  not  currently 
commercially available. For example, the cap-and-trade system for power generation 
and industry in the 450 Policy Scenario is assumed to drive $670 billion of CCS, including 
retro-fitting, while the sectoral agreements in transport lead to the introduction of 
advanced  biofuels  and  the  penetration  of  electric  and  fuel-cell  vehicles.  In  order 
to make this a reality, substantial research and development efforts will be needed
(Box  19.1).  In  any  case,  there  is  a  real  chance  that  some  of  these  technological 
breakthroughs will not materialise, which would lead to much higher marginal abatement 
costs between 2020 and 2030 in order still to meet the 450 emissions trajectory.

Box 19.1 z  Stepping up research, development and demonstration to 
promote climate-friendly technologies
While the 550 Policy Scenario could, in theory, be achieved through the widespread 
deployment  of  existing  carbon-efficient  technologies,  further  technological 
progress will greatly facilitate, and lower the costs of, meeting it. The 450 Policy 
Scenario can only be achieved through stepped-up research, development and 
subsequent demonstration and deployment of technologies. In recognition of this, 
countries agreed at COP 13 in Bali that energy-sector research and development 
from  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  needs  to  be  scaled-up  significantly
and quickly. 
The private sector currently accounts for around 80-85% of global energy-sector 
research and development, and will need to continue to provide much of the 
effort, and in most cases will be best placed to do so. There is evidence that 
private research in clean technology is increasing. Recent years have seen strong 
interest  from  venture  capital  and  private  equity  firms,  where  clean  energy 
technology  forms  over  three-quarters  of  proposals.  According  to  the  United 
Nations Environmental Programme, over $148 billion in new funding entered the 
sustainable energy sector in 2007, up 60% from 2006 (UNEP, 2008). 
By creating demand for low-carbon technologies, carbon markets, sectoral targets 
and national policies will all play a crucial role in providing the incentives for the 
private sector to invest and innovate. The development of more competitive 
energy  markets  and  stable  institutions  will  also  encourage  private  sector 
innovation. However, by themselves, these measures will be insufficient because 
of other barriers and market failures that inhibit research and development of 
low-carbon technologies: 
The  requirement  for  short  payback  periods  may  prevent  firms  from   z
investing in energy technologies that are profitable only in the long term 
(such as CCS).
The  spin-off  benefits  of  some  energy  technologies  for  other  sectors  or   z
technologies that may be difficult for energy firms to capture.
Supply-side bottlenecks, such as planning delays and skills shortages, can   z
hinder innovation and may be particularly strong in non-OECD countries.
Moreover, creating long-term, credible demand for low-carbon technologies may 
be difficult to achieve, especially in the short term, while the time taken for 
technology development means that innovation needs to start now. Governments 
and international organisations have a key role to play in reducing these barriers 
and supporting research and development.
Recognising these benefits, most governments around the world already support 
research — but there is need for expansion. Despite increasing slightly in recent 
years,  public  spending  on  research  and  development  in  the  energy  sector  in 
real terms is around half the level it was 25 years ago. Moreover, while many

Box 19.1 z  Stepping up research, development and demonstration to 
promote climate-friendly technologies  (continued)
governments have made commitments to increase investment, much of this has 
not yet materialised and what has been done is relatively modest in ambition. If 
the technology breakthroughs envisaged in the Policy Scenarios are to be realised, 
public  sector  budgets  need  to  be  rebuilt  and  sustained.  This  funding  should 
complement or leverage, rather than crowd-out, private sector investment. 
Given  the  global  scale  and  urgency  of  the  challenge,  improved  international 
collaboration is also needed and should be a key part of a post-2012 agreement. 
IEA  Implementing  Agreements  already  provide  opportunities  for  countries 
to  co-operate  actively  in  the  research  and  development  of  low-carbon 
technologies.
Replacement of capital stock in the power sector
As discussed in Chapter 17, the rate of capital replacement in the power sector has an 
important influence on the speed at which new technologies can be deployed — and 
therefore on how quickly the energy sector can be transformed to deliver a cleaner 
energy mix, improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in CO
2
 emissions. In 
OECD+ countries, the capital stock is ageing in the power sector: 40% of the plant stock 
is now over 30 years old and most importantly, over half of coal-fired capacity is older 
than 30 years (Figure 19.11).

Policies  to  encourage  the  retirement  of  the  older  and  most  inefficient  fossil-fuel 
plants in the OECD+ countries can speed up the rate of capital turnover and open 
up the “window for action” associated with the replacement of plant at the end of 
its useful life (see Chapter 17). In both Policy Scenarios, the carbon price resulting 
from the cap-and-trade system provides this incentive. In particular, it influences the

lifetime of coal-fired plants, as some of the least-efficient and most polluting coal-
fired power plants become uneconomic and are retired earlier. However, seeing this 
major transformation through will be a test of global resolve in curbing CO
2
 emissions. 
Box  19.2  illustrates  how  a  policy  to  shut  down  coal-fired  power  plants  in  Ontario, 
Canada has proven to be a major challenge.
In Other Major Economies and Other Countries, Reference Scenario emissions grow 
much  faster  than  in  OECD+,  requiring  additional  power-generation  capacity  and 
therefore  presenting  greater  opportunity  for  emissions  abatement  relative  to  this 
scenario.  However,  any  delay  in  implementing  emissions-reduction  policies  will 
reduce the likelihood of the world achieving its climate-change goal. In the absence 
of incentives to invest in low-carbon technologies over the 2012-2020 period, the CO
2 
mitigation  potential  in  the  power  sector  in  non-OECD  countries  would  be  reduced 
significantly,  because  less  efficient  solutions  become  locked  in.  Although  power 
plants in these regions are relatively new — 73% of capacity is less than 20 years old — 
government policies can still accelerate capital stock turnover in some cases. In China, 
for example, the government has a policy to shut down small and inefficient coal-fired 
power plants. Additional emissions reductions can come from upgrading existing power 
plants in these two regions. Fitting at least some of coal plants to be constructed 
between  now  and  2020  with  CCS  could  yield  significant  emissions  abatement.  The 
possibility of tapping such potential is, however, critically dependent on the success 
of demonstration and deployment programmes for CCS in OECD+ countries before 2020 
and on the improvement of the framework for international collaboration on financing 
and technology.
In the 450 Policy Scenario, the need for new power plants after 2020 rises considerably, 
relative to the Reference and 550 Policy Scenarios. Capacity additions in the decade 
from 2021 to 2030 amount to around 3 000 GW, over 50% higher than in the Reference 
and 550 Policy Scenarios. Many coal-fired power plants are shut down and replaced 
with low-carbon technologies: almost 120 GW of additional coal plant capacity will be 
replaced by coal plants with CCS, relative to the 550 Policy Scenario (see Chapter 18). 
Two-thirds of these coal capacity additions will take place in Other Major Economies 
and will then account for almost a tenth of installed coal capacity in this region. This 
presents a major logistical challenge for manufacturers of power plants. In general, it 
is more difficult to expand the production of complex technologies, such as nuclear 
power and CCS, compared with technologies such as wind turbines and photovoltaics. 
Box 19.2 z  Shutting down coal-fired power plants in Ontario, Canada
In  Canada,  provinces  oversee,  and  in  many  cases  own,  the  electric  power 
systems  within  their  borders.  In  2003,  the  government  of  Ontario,  Canada’s 
largest province, announced a policy to retire all coal-fired generation by 2007 
for environmental and health reasons. The 7 560 MW of generating capacity, 
operated by the provincially owned Ontario Power Generation, accounted for 25% 
of the province’s installed generation capacity and 33 Mt of CO
2
 emissions.

494 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
Box 19.2 z  Shutting down coal-fired power plants in Ontario, Canada  (continued)
Implementation of this policy has been beset by technical, cost and environmental 
challenges. The largest technical challenge arises from the amount of capacity 
that needed to be replaced and the role of that capacity in balancing electricity 
supply with demand. While the government processes to procure replacement 
capacity began within months of the policy announcement, several years will 
pass before sufficient replacement capacity is in place. Upgrades to the grid 
have  also  proven  necessary  as  large,  central  coal-fired  stations  are  replaced 
by smaller, more geographically dispersed gas-fired and renewable generation. 
These technical challenges are the primary reason for a seven-year delay in the 
original phase out date — from 2007 to 2014.
The main costs arise from the costs of the replacement gas-fired generation, 
installations to make use of renewable resources (primarily wind), conservation 
measures and the cost of transmission upgrades. The government has created an 
agency to procure these supply and conservation resources, and a mechanism to 
pass the costs through to consumers. While it is difficult to estimate how much 
of this investment is aimed strictly at coal replacement, the cost of gas-fired 
generation  and  transmission  expenditures  alone  amounts  to  $6.4  billion.  The 
replacement generation capacity is being obtained through long-term contracts 
with generators, leaving the risks of capacity under-utilisation with electricity 
consumers.  Furthermore,  prices  in  the  wholesale  market  are  anticipated  to 
increase as coal-fired generation, which currently sets the market price over
50% of the time, is replaced by gas-fired generation.
The Ontario government is relying on the coal phase-out to contribute 44% of 
Ontario’s greenhouse-gas emissions reductions by 2015 under its Climate Change 
Action Plan. The ultimate global environmental impact and the ultimate cost 
to Ontario’s electricity consumers of the current policy are difficult to assess 
because the Ontario electricity market is interconnected with the neighbouring 
states of New York and Michigan in the United States. Ontario power production 
is,  accordingly,  competing  with  power  generators  in  these  states  and  other 
nearby states in the United States that rely heavily on coal for power generation, 
such as Ohio and Indiana. Ontario is currently a significant net exporter of power, 
of which a significant fraction comes from coal. There are no restrictions on CO
2
 
emissions in most of these neighbouring jurisdictions.
For these reasons, as coal-fired generation is restricted and eliminated within 
Ontario, coal-fired generation in the neighbouring jurisdictions can be expected 
to increase — both to replace exports of Ontario energy and through increased 
imports to Ontario. The increase in imports would be expected to mitigate price 
rises within the Ontario market by reducing gas-fired power production within 
Ontario  but  also,  when  these  imports  are  from  coal-fired  generation,  reduce 
the  global  environmental  benefit  from  the  coal  phase  out.  Substantial  global 
environmental  benefits  are  likely  only  if  neighbouring  jurisdictions  adopt  a 
carbon-emissions policy of similar stringency.

Technology diffusion and interaction with carbon 
markets
In both the 550 Policy Scenario and the 450 Policy Scenario, in order to achieve global 
abatement most efficiently, a substantial emissions reduction takes place in Other 
Countries. This will almost certainly go beyond the formal responsibilities allocated to 
these countries in a post-2012 agreement and include abatement paid for by developed 
countries, to offset their own abatement obligations. Consequently, there must be a 
mechanism to enable trade on this scale to take place, ensuring allocative efficiency, 
as well as worldwide availability of the most efficient low-carbon technologies, to 
ensure productive efficiency.
The  Policy  Scenarios  are  therefore  underpinned  by  a  flexible  global  trading 
environment, which assumes that there is a substantial world carbon market, as well 
as  effective  diffusion  of  technologies  and  technological  expertise  across  countries. 
Ensuring that the post-2012 reality reflects these assumptions constitutes a crucial 
policy challenge.
Carbon markets
A market for trading emissions credits is important for ensuring that abatement occurs 
at least cost. Where countries’ marginal costs of abatement differ, all parties can be 
made better off by the ability to buy and sell emissions credits. The climate change 
impact will be the same wherever the greenhouse gases are emitted.
There already exists a rapidly-expanding global carbon market, with trade in 2007 of 
around 3 Gt CO
2
-eq, with a financial value of over $64 billion (Figure 19.12). This trade 
was derived from existing regimes, most notably the EU ETS (accounting for $50 billion 
of trade in 2007) and the Clean Development Mechanism ($13 billion). China was by far 
the biggest seller of CDM credits, with a market share of 73% of transactions. A future 
global climate regime could build upon and expand the existing carbon market.
In its simplest form, a carbon market would feature just those countries and sectors 
participating in cap-and-trade arrangements (i.e. power generation and industry in 
OECD+  in  our  scenarios).  This  would  lead  to  some  trading  and  cheaper  abatement 
than  if  participating  countries  were  bound  to  meet  their  targets  through  domestic 
abatement only. However, abatement costs and potentials are likely to be relatively 
similar across these countries, so that the amount of trading that takes place would 
be limited. Many of the most cost-effective abatement options are in Other Major 
Economies and Other Countries, where carbon intensities are typically higher. Even 
after taking into account the implementation of national policies and measures, there 
are likely to be substantial possibilities for abatement that would be cheaper than 
in developed countries. Consequently, a more comprehensive carbon market, which 
allows countries outside the cap-and-trade framework to participate, promises greater 
global cost savings, to the benefit of both OECD+ countries, which could meet their 
emissions allowances at lower cost, and non-OECD+ countries, which could accumulate 
and sell emissions credits.

496 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
In both the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios, we assume some scope for those countries 
in the cap-and-trade system to purchase emissions credits from those countries not 
directly participating in it. However, incorporating countries without emissions caps 
into a global carbon market creates a fundamental design problem. If countries or 
businesses receive emissions credits for activities they would have undertaken anyway, 
this is not new abatement relative to business as usual. Given that countries buying 
credits are entitled to achieve less abatement themselves, there would be a risk of 
not meeting the expected global emissions trajectory. The CDM currently attempts 
to  overcome  this  problem  by  imposing  “additionality”  criteria,  including  allowing 
CDM accreditation only for projects that would not go ahead without the CDM funding
(Box 19.3). In practice, this is an imperfect system and in its current form would be 
too high-risk and too logistically demanding to be appropriate for the scale of carbon 
market transactions that would result from a global agreement.

As Other Major Economies and Other Countries assume greater national responsibilities, 
whether  through  formalised  policies  and  measures  or  sectoral  agreements,  the 
additionality  issue  will  become  even  more  complex,  as  emissions  credits  should  be 
allocated only over and above fulfilment of those responsibilities. Another potential 
challenge is that CDM credits are currently allocated on a project-by-project basis. 
If  a  country’s  efforts  are  expressed  in  terms  of  national  policies  and  measures,  or 
participation in sectoral agreements, these cannot readily be translated into quantified 
emissions  at  project  level  in  order  to  determine  additionality. 8   Nevertheless,  the 
8.  For example, it is not enough to justify accreditation for a proposed power plant that betters an average 
sectoral standard, as a country may need to introduce such plants anyway, in order to compensate for those 
plants that are worse than the standard.

economic benefits of global carbon trading, as well as the practicalities of meeting 
ambitious emissions targets, necessitate that a solution be reached to allow all countries 
to participate in a global carbon market. 
Box 19.3 z  What next for the Clean Development Mechanism?
The number of projects registered under the CDM has grown rapidly over recent 
years. However, the complex project cycle and administrative process dampens 
its  success.  The  main  difficulty  lies  in  proving  that  a  CDM  project  would  not 
be  viable  without  the  expected  revenues  from  Certified  Emissions  Reductions 
(CERs). This so-called “additionality” criterion is seen as essential to ensure the 
environmental contribution of each project. 
The  requirements  to  implement  a  CDM  project,  the  set  of  rules  and  regulatory 
processes administering these rules, and a strong regional and sectoral concentration 
led Parties to consider improvements. One innovation is so-called programmatic CDM, 
allowing project activities under a programme to be registered as a single project. 
Activities that implement a policy or standard can now be submitted as a single CDM 
project. This evolution is a step forward but difficulties remain, particularly the 
requirement to measure emission reductions at each project activity. 
Recent research shows that CDM risks delivering fewer emission reductions than 
information  on  registered  projects  suggests.  Many  CDM  projects  face  serious 
underperformance;  by  June  2007,  only  76%  of  the  initially  forecast  emissions 
reductions were actually issued. 9  
The CDM has been successful in revealing cost-effective emission reductions and 
raising  the  awareness  of  climate  mitigation  in  non-OECD  countries.  Efforts  are 
warranted  to  make  it  accessible  to  countries  and  sectors  where  it  has  not  yet 
penetrated: the CDM’s contribution to changing energy production and use in non-
OECD countries has, so far, been extremely limited, with CO
2 
savings amounting to 
some 1.9 Gt between 2000 and 2012.
At the same time, some climate policy experts question the urge to expand a system 
that merely compensates for other countries’ excess emissions. Further, as countries 
grow, and increase their emissions, they will need to contribute more to global 
abatement, going beyond CDM-funded measures. With the Policy Scenarios implying 
much greater potential for CDM-style transactions, and with Other Countries already 
assumed  to  adopt  national  policies  and  measures  that  count  towards  the  global 
emissions reduction effort, an improved system will be essential.
Ultimately, the most workable solution would be for more countries to graduate over 
time to the system of national emissions allowances. As discussed in Chapter 17, given 
the  potential  to  allocate  emissions  according  to  any  desired  criteria,  the  solution 
adopted need not penalise non-OECD countries. In fact, some of these countries could

498 World Energy Outlook 2008 - THE ROLE OF ENERGY IN CLIMATE POLICY
even be offered generous allowances, relative to their current emissions, to encourage 
global adoption of the more efficient system. It is also likely to be advantageous to link 
other sectors to the global carbon market, in order to realise allocative efficiency gains 
from a more harmonised global framework.
As with any energy-trading system or financial market, a global carbon market should 
conform to principles of liquidity, transparency, efficiency and security. A full range 
of derivative products will be important in order to provide the energy sector with 
maximum  flexibility  to  achieve  its  objectives.  However  emissions  allowances  are 
defined,  the  ability  to  bank  credits  (for  example,  by  undertaking  additional  early 
abatement)  will  be  important  in  order  to  promote  the  most  efficient  timing  of 
abatement  activities.  In  theory,  an  efficient  carbon  market  will  equalise  spot  and 
future carbon prices, adjusting for interest rates and risk. 10
Auctioning of emissions allowances
As well as a need for institutions and a market to enable carbon trading, there will 
need to be a means of allocating emissions allowances that form part of the cap-
and-trade system in power generation and industry to emitting companies and other 
economic  agents.  This  could  be  left  to  individual  countries  to  decide  according  to 
their individual circumstances but for competitiveness reasons, a consistent approach 
across countries is desirable. Free allocation based on benchmarking — which reflects 
efficiency improvement efforts to date — would be an option to promote equity and 
avoid  damaging  the  international  competitiveness  of  companies.  Another  option  is 
auctioning, which allows the revenues to accrue to governments, rather than as windfall 
profits.  There  are  many  international  precedents  to  auctioning  energy  allowances. 11  
Based on our scenarios, annual revenue from auctioning in 2030 could exceed $400 billion 
in the 550 Policy Scenario and $1 800 billion in the 450 Policy Scenario, depending on the 
proportion of emissions auctioned and assuming they were sold at the carbon prices set 
out in Chapter 18. To put these numbers into perspective, cumulative revenues from full 
auctioning between 2013 and 2030 would exceed all the additional investments (relative 
to the Reference Scenario) in efficiency and power plants, in both the 550 and 450 Policy 
Scenarios (Figure 19.13).
Governments  would  have  a  range  of  options  on  how  to  make  efficient  use  of  the 
substantial  revenues  raised  from  auctioning.  One  option,  the  most  economically 
efficient  from  a  theoretical  perspective, 12   is  to  use  the  revenue  to  cut  existing 
distortive national taxes such as employment taxes. More generally, these revenues 
could  be  used  to  implement  a  broad  reform  of  the  fiscal  base,  contributing,  for 
example,  to  the  financing  of  health  or  pension  systems.  However,  recognising  the 
transformational challenge presented by the Policy Scenarios, all or part of the money 
could be channelled back into the energy sector, to provide financial incentives for 
businesses and households to undertake efficient investments, to fund research and 
development  in  low-carbon  technologies,  or  for  wider  climate-change  initiatives. 
10. A major source of risk will be uncertainty over the future of a global climate change regime. If allowan-
ces for future trading periods are unknown, or there is a lack of conﬁ dence in the continuation of a global 
regime, this will lead to serious deﬁ ciencies in the functioning of the carbon market. An agreement on a 
post-2012 framework needs to inspire such conﬁ dence.

Similar ideas have been proposed in respect of revenues from the auctioning of EU ETS 
allowances. 13  While different countries will have different political priorities for the 
use of such extra revenues, in the context of wider tax and consumer debates, these 
emissions allowance revenues could form a valuable element of climate-policy action 
in the energy sector, helping to generate public interest in and support for the cap-and-
trade system (Hepburn et al., 2006).

Of course, regions may not wish to engage in full auctioning (indeed, the EU ETS has 
been  increasing  auctioning  only  gradually).  However,  even  with  partial  auctioning, 
substantial  revenues  could  be  raised.  With  only  10%  auctioning,  revenues  in  OECD 
countries between 2021 and 2030 would outweigh current public energy sector R&D in 
these countries by a factor of five. 
Technology diffusion
The Policy Scenarios show the need for emissions reduction across all regions and across 
all sectors. Achieving this in an efficient manner will depend on all regions having 
access to the best available technologies. This is particularly important in the power 
sector, which in the 550 Policy Scenario accounts for almost two-thirds of the reduction 
in energy-related CO
2
, relative to the Reference Scenario. The Policy Scenarios assume

of climate change, to fund research and development for reducing emissions and adapting, to develop re-

most notably, carbon capture and storage. While much of the development of this 
technology is currently being undertaken within the OECD+ countries, much of its early 
deployment will need to be in Other Major Economies such as China. 
There are a number of barriers to address in order to maximise the potential from 
technologies.  These  include  imperfect  information,  high  transactions  costs,  risk, 
financing, complex regulatory frameworks and other trade and market barriers (IEA, 
2008). Consequently, there are actions that can be taken to improve the potential 
for technology transfer. At the most fundamental level, this involves continuing to 
promote free trade and undistorted, competitive global markets. An important first 
step in this regard would be the removal of energy-related subsidies in many non-OECD 
countries (see Chapter 1) and the establishment of a global carbon market.
To overcome information barriers, international knowledge sharing is likely to play a 
key  role.  The  IEA’s  Energy  Technology  Collaboration  programme  promotes  exchanges 
of expertise across both OECD and non-OECD countries; its Implementing Agreements, 
covering  various  aspects  of  building,  transport,  fossil  fuels,  nuclear  and  renewables, 
provide a framework to enhance the most efficient use of energy worldwide. Other major 
initiatives include the Asia-Pacific Partnership’s “State-of-the-art Clean Technologies” 
handbooks, which identify the most efficient technologies within each sector. It is also 
important that all countries have effective intellectual property laws, to provide countries 
and companies with the confidence to export high-tech, energy-efficient technologies 
and expertise to the regions where abatement needs to take place (Box 19.4).
Box 19.4 z  The importance of intellectual property laws for technology diffusion
Effective  intellectual  property  laws  are  often  important  to  facilitate  technology 
diffusion. While such laws are generally well advanced in OECD countries, they are 
less well established in some non-OECD countries. The poorest countries, because 
they lack resources to imitate and reproduce existing technology (UK Commission on 
Intellectual Property Rights, 2002), tend to give low priority to strong intellectual 
property laws. However, an effective intellectual property system is important 
for enabling countries to attract the transfer of new technologies.
Where intellectual property cannot be safeguarded, because laws are weak or 
are not enforced, foreigners have less incentive to share new technologies, both 
supply-side  and  demand-side.  This  constrains  efficient  global  abatement  and 
energy technology development. An OECD empirical study (Park and Lippoldt, 
2008)  found  that  strong  intellectual  property  laws  stimulate  innovation  and 
diffusion (particularly of technology-intensive goods, as is typical in the energy 
sector). The study also showed a strong correlation between robust intellectual 
property laws and foreign direct investment, both for developing and developed 
countries.
As  a  consequence,  it  is  essential  for  the  global  abatement  effort  that  the 
international community addresses the issue of more robust intellectual property 
laws in key non-OECD countries. The WTO’s 1995 Agreement in Trade-Related

Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), requiring WTO members to ensure 
that intellectual property rights do not become barriers to trade, is clearly a step in 
the right direction. TRIPS itself says little in relation to technology transfer, requiring 
only  that  its  member  countries  provide  incentives  to  industry  to  promote  and 
encourage technology transfer to the WTO’s least-developed member countries.
Given that technologies will need to be deployed worldwide, this must be taken into 
account during the research and development phase. Technologies need to cater for 
multiple markets. As most research currently takes place in OECD countries, it will be 
important to take into account the needs of other regions. This can in part be ensured 
by  promoting  an  effective  global  carbon  market,  which  will  provide  incentives  to 
develop such technologies, but can be further encouraged by international public sector 
collaboration, including with non-OECD countries, during the technology development 
phase. A positive example of this is the UK-China Near Zero Emissions Coal initiative, 
where joint research and development is taking place on CCS technology, with a view 
to demonstration projects in both countries.
There already exist a number of substantial funds and institutions to support technology 
diffusion. In 2008, the World Bank created the Climate Investment Funds, to provide 
interim, scaled-up funding to help developing countries mitigate their greenhouse-gas 
emissions. Total investment is targeted to reach $5 billion over three years. Current 
World Bank energy funding amounts to $1.8 billion. Our Policy Scenarios indicate that 
much more will be needed going forward.
Implications for policy
The sheer scale of the transformation to the energy sector in both the 450 and 550 
Policy  Scenarios  would  place  a  substantial  burden  on  both  the  private  and  public 
sectors. Countries must shift away from traditional, carbon-intensive technologies and 
embrace new ones. It is for governments to galvanise the transformation.
A necessary first step is ensuring the right business climate, to enable energy-efficient 
investments to be made when and where they will deliver greatest value. The removal 
of distortive energy subsidies and development of a global carbon market will be very 
important. Delivering a low-carbon future requires major breakthroughs in technology 
development and deployment. Governments have the means to put in place incentives 
to innovate, to encourage promising research activities and to break down international 
barriers.
Much of the additional spending in the 450 and 550 Policy Scenarios is by households: 
a huge step-change in the attitudes to energy efficiency and consumer purchases by 
hundreds of millions of people worldwide is needed. Governments, through information 
provision, sound regulation and targeted fiscal incentives, have a key role to play in 
ensuring that, worldwide, the right decisions are taken to safeguard the future of the 
energy sector — and of the planet.

 Emissions from Fuel Combustion. 
The definitions for regions, fuels and sectors can be found in Annex B.
Both in the text of this book and in the tables, rounding may cause some differences 
between the total and the sum of the individual components.  Growth rates are marked 
“n.a.” when the base year is zero or the value exceeds 200%.
Definitional note to the tables
Total primary energy demand is equivalent to power generation plus other energy 
sector excluding electricity and heat, plus total final consumption excluding electricity 
and heat.  Total primary energy demand does not include ambient heat from heat 
pumps nor electricity trade. Power generation includes electricity and heat production 
by main activity producers and autoproducers. Other sectors includes final consumption 
in the residential, services, agricultural, and non-specified sectors.  Total CO
2 
emissions 
(calculated  using  the  IPCC  Tier  1  Sectoral  Approach)  include  emissions  from  other 
energy  sector,  as  well  as  from  power  generation,  and  total  final  consumption  (as 
shown in the tables). CO
2 
emissions from international marine bunkers and international 
aviation are included at the world level. CO
2
 emissions do not include emissions from 
industrial waste and non-renewable municipal waste.

Fuel definitions
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a diesel-equivalent, processed fuel made from the transesterification  (a 
chemical process which removes the glycerine from the oil) of both vegetable oils and 
animal fats.
Biofuels
Biofuels includes ethanol and biodiesel.
Biogas
A mixture of methane and carbon dioxide produced by bacterial degradation of organic 
matter and used as a fuel.
Biomass and waste
Solid biomass, gas and liquids derived from biomass, industrial waste and the renewable 
part of municipal waste. 
Brown coal
Includes lignite and sub-bituminous coal where lignite is defined as non-agglomerating 
coal with a gross calorific value less than 4 165 kcal/kg and sub-bituminous coal is 
defined as non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value between 4 165 kcal/kg 
and 5 700 kcal/kg.
Clean coal technologies 
Clean  coal  technologies  (CCTs)  are  designed  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  the 
environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation and use.
Coal 
Coal includes both primary coal (including hard coal and lignite) and derived fuels 
(including patent fuel, brown-coal briquettes, coke-oven coke, gas coke, coke-oven 
gas,  blast-furnace  gas  and  oxygen  steel  furnace  gas).  Peat  is  also  included  in  this 
category.

Annex B – Abbreviations, definitions and conversion factors 543
B
Coalbed methane
Methane found in coal seams. Coalbed methane is a source of non-conventional natural 
gas.
Coal-to-liquids
Coal-to-liquids (CTL) refers to both coal gasification, combined with Fischer- Tropsch 
synthesis  to  produce  liquid  fuels,  and  the  less-developed  direct-coal  liquefaction 
technologies.
Condensates
Condensates  are  liquid  hydrocarbon  mixtures  recovered  from  non-associated  gas 
reservoirs.  They  are  composed  of  C4  and  higher  carbon  number  hydrocarbons  and 
normally have an API between 50° and 85°. 
Dimethyl ether
Clear, odourless gas currently produced by dehydration of methanol from natural gas, 
but which can also be produced from biomass or coal. 
Ethanol
Ethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting any biomass high in carbohydrates. Today, 
ethanol is made from starches and sugars, but second-generation technologies will 
allow it to be made from cellulose and hemicellulose, the fibrous material that makes 
up the bulk of most plant matter.
Gas
Gas includes natural gas (both associated and non-associated with petroleum deposits 
but excluding natural gas liquids) and gas-works gas.
Gas-to-liquids
Fischer-Tropsch technology is used to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (syngas) 
and then, through catalytic reforming or synthesis, into very clean conventional oil 
products. The main fuel produced in most GTL plants is diesel.
Hard coal 
Coal  of  gross  calorific  value  greater  than  5  700  kcal/kg  on  an  ash-free  but  moist 
basis. Hard coal can be further disaggregated into anthracite, coking coal and other 
bituminous coal.

World Energy Outlook 2008 - ANNEXES 544
Heavy petroleum products
Heavy petroleum products include heavy fuel oil.
Hydropower
Hydropower refers to the energy content of the electricity produced in hydropower 
plants, assuming 100% efficiency. It excludes output from pumped storage plants.
Light petroleum products
Light  petroleum  products  include  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG),  naphtha  and 
gasoline.
Middle distillates
Middle distillates include jet fuel, diesel and heating oil.
Modern renewables
Includes hydropower, biomass (excluding traditional use) and other renewables.
Natural gas liquids
Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are the liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in 
the  manufacture,  purification  and  stabilisation  of  natural  gas.  These  are  those 
portions of natural gas which are recovered as liquids in separators, field facilities, 
or gas processing plants. NGLs include, but are not limited to, ethane, propane, 
butane, pentane, natural gasoline and condensates. 
Nuclear
Nuclear refers to the primary heat equivalent of the electricity produced by a nuclear 
plant with an average thermal efficiency of 33%. 
Oil
Oil  includes  crude  oil,  condensates,  natural  gas  liquids,  refinery  feedstocks  and 
additives, other hydrocarbons (including emulsified oils, synthetic crude oil, mineral 
oils extracted from bituminous minerals such as oil shale, bituminous sand and oils 
from coal liquefaction), and petroleum products (refinery gas, ethane, LPG, aviation 
gasoline, motor gasoline, jet fuels, kerosene, gas/diesel oil, heavy fuel oil, naphtha, 
white spirit, lubricants, bitumen, paraffin waxes and petroleum coke).

Annex B – Abbreviations, definitions and conversion factors 545
B
Other renewables
Includes geothermal, solar PV, solar thermal, wind, tide and wave energy for electricity 
generation and heat production. 
Rest of renewables
Includes biomass and waste, geothermal, solar PV, solar thermal, wind, tide and wave 
energy for electricity generation and heat production. 
Traditional biomass
Traditional biomass refers to the use of fuelwood, animal dung and agricultural residues 
in stoves with very low efficiencies.
Process definitions
Electricity generation
Electricity generation is the total amount of electricity generated by power plants. It 
includes own use and transmission and distribution losses.
Greenfield
The construction of plants or facilities in new areas or where no previous infrastructure 
exists.
International marine bunkers
International  marine  bunkers  covers  those  quantities  delivered  to  sea-going  ships 
that are engaged in international navigation. The international navigation may take 
place at sea, on inland lakes and waterways, and in coastal waters. Consumption by 
ships engaged in domestic navigation is excluded. The domestic/international split is 
determined on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival, and not by the flag 
or nationality of the ship. Consumption by fishing vessels and by military forces is also 
excluded.
Lower heating value 
Lower heating value is the heat liberated by the complete combustion of a unit of 
fuel when the water produced is assumed to remain as a vapour and the heat is not 
recovered.
© OECD/IEA, 2008
World Energy Outlook 2008 - ANNEXES 546
Natural decline rate
The base production decline rate of an oil or gas field without intervention to enhance 
production.
Observed decline rate
The production decline rate of an oil or gas field after all measures have been taken to 
maximise production. It is the aggregation of all the production increases and declines 
of new and mature oil or gas fields in a particular region.
Other energy sector
Other energy sector covers the use of energy by transformation industries and the 
energy losses in converting primary energy into a form that can be used in the final 
consuming sectors. It includes losses by gas works, petroleum refineries, and coal and 
gas transformation and liquefaction. It also includes energy used in coal mines, in oil 
and gas extraction, and in electricity and heat production. Transfers and statistical 
differences are also included in this category.
Residential, services and agriculture 
This sector also includes energy use in the forestry, fishing and non-specified sectors. It 
also theoretically includes military fuel use for all mobile and stationary consumption 
(e.g. ships, aircraft, road and energy used in living quarters) regardless of whether the 
fuel delivered is for the military of that country or for the military of another country. 
In practice, many countries find this difficult to report.
Power generation
Power generation refers to fuel use in electricity plants, heat plants and combined 
heat and power (CHP) plants. Both main activity producer plants and small plants that 
produce fuel for their own use (autoproducers) are included.
Total final consumption
Total final consumption is the sum of consumption by the different end-use sectors. 
TFC is broken down into energy demand in the following sectors: industry (including 
manufacturing  and  mining),  transport,  other  (including  residential,  commercial 
and  public  services,  agriculture/forestry  and  fishing),  non-energy  use  (including 
petrochemical feedstocks), and non-specified. 
Total primary energy demand 
Total  primary  energy  demand  represents  domestic  demand  only,  including 
power generation, other energy sector, and total final consumption. It excludes 
international marine bunkers, except for world primary energy demand, where it 
is included.
